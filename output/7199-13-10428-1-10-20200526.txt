Abstract
Social media has become a preferential place for sharing
information. However, some users may create multiple ac-
counts and manipulate them to deceive legitimate users. Most
previous studies utilize verbal or behavior features based
methods to solve this problem, but they are only designed for
some particular platforms, leading to low universalness.
In this paper, to support multiple platforms, we construct in-
teraction tree for each account based on their social inter-
actions which is common characteristic of social platforms.
Then we propose a new method to calculate the social inter-
action entropy of each account and detect the accounts which
are controlled by the same user. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets show that the method has robust superior-
ity over state-of-the-art methods.
Introduction
Multiple identities (sockpuppets) detection is a critical issue
in social media. Previous studies (Kumar et al., 2017; Wang
et al., 2018) have shown that sockpuppets are often applied
to manipulate public opinion and heavily affect the user ex-
perience.
Recent studies focus on proﬁle similarity based (Keselj
et al., 2003; Li et al., 2017), verbal based (Solorio, Hasan,
and Mizan, 2013) and behavior features based (Tsikerdekis
and Zeadally, 2014) methods to detect the sockpuppets. Pro-
ﬁle similarity based methods use the account proﬁle, such
as nickname
(Keselj et al., 2003) and description of ac-
count (Li et al., 2017), for detection. Verbal based methods
assume that sockpuppets have similar linguistic traits (Ku-
mar et al., 2017) and extract text and semantic features from
posts and comments. However, smart malicious users could
change nicknames and writing style to disguise themselves.
Thus, behavior feature based methods are proposed to an-
alyze account behaviors, such as the total number of bytes
removed from all the revisions (Tsikerdekis et al,2014), co-
occurrence relationship (Liu et al., 2016). However, pre-
vious methods have high dependence on the particular plat-
forms, thus lack generalization. For example, as a video plat-

form, TikTok can hardly provide useful text to extract verbal
features. In this paper, we propose a platform-independent
interaction entropy method based on the social interaction
activity. The method can be easily applied to many social
media platforms.
The contribution of this work can be concluded as fol-
lows: (1) We apply the interaction activities, which are avail-
able on mainstream social platforms, to extract general fea-
tures that are easily available from many platforms. (2) We
propose a novel interaction entropy algorithm to depict the
interaction activities of users for sockpuppets detection. (3)
The experimental results achieve a signiﬁcant performance
over state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness
of our method.
Methodology
We extract the interaction activity from interaction logs and
construct interaction tree as shown in Figure 1. Then we
propose the interaction entropy based on the interaction tree
inspired by the ideal of the graph entropy (Dehmer, 2008).
Firstly, we deﬁne user interaction set Du = {du
i |u ∈ U, i ∈
M}, where du
i is the interaction tree of account u based on
message i, U is the set of users and M denotes the messages
in the social network. The function |S(v, du
i )| denotes the
depth of node v in du
i as shown in Figure 2. For a node v ∈
du
i , we deﬁne the node entropy function:
f(v) = |S(v, du
i )| · C(v)
C(du
i ),
(1)
where C(v) is the number of account v in du
i (an account
may appear many times in one tree) and C(du
i ) is the num-
ber of nodes in the tree du
i . Then we propose an function to
represent the entropy of the interaction tree du
i .
Hp(du
i ) =
C(du
i )
�
i=0
−p(v, du
i ) · log p(v, du
i ),
(2)
where p(v, du
i ) =
f(v)
�C(du
i=0i )
αf(v) is the probability mass func-
tion for the tree. The hyperparameters α is a shrinkage fac-
tor. According to the above deﬁnition, a tree has more di-
verse interactions when it has a lower entropy value.

the interaction link list from interaction logs and merge the
link list with the same head such as username and tweet.

Figure 2: The depth of interaction tree, for example
|S(B, du
i )| = 2. The depth is an integer starting with 1 at
the deepest leaf node for the convenience of calculation.
Then, we obtain an interaction entropy of account u which
indicates interaction diversity.
If(u) =
|Du|

i=0
−Hp(du
i ) · log2 Hp(du

where |Du| is the size of set Du.
Based on the interaction entropy, we show the multiple
identities deception detection algorithm. Given accounts u
and v, we will get the function G to depict the social interac-
tion activity difference, which can be formalized as follows:
G(u, v) =
����
If(u)
If(v) − 1.0
���� .
(4)
Finally, we can obtain the result to discriminate for multiple
identities via the function G.
G(u, v) =

⩽ β

> β

(5)
where β is a threshold and the accounts whose difference
score below the β is controlled by the same malicious user.
Experiments and Result
Datasets. In this paper, we conduct experiments on two real-
world datasets DS and DT which are public available at
(Wang et al., 2018). The DS dataset contains 675 users. The
DT dataset contains 991 users. Accounts are identiﬁed as
sockpuppets according to rules, such as self-reported sen-
tence matching like ’This is a sockpuppet of Mix’.
Experiments In the experiments, we set the model parame-
ters as: α = 2.3, β = 0.6. The analyses of parameter sensi-
tivity can be found in the supplemental materials. As shown
in the Table 1, our model achieves signiﬁcantly improve-
ment over state-of-the-art methods on two datasets (+2.5-
30.5% in terms of F1), which shows the effectiveness of
the model. Furthermore, the interaction relations are eas-
ily available on mainstream social media platforms, such as
Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, etc., thus the algorithm has wider
applications compared with previous methods.
Conclusion
In this paper, we study the multiple identities deception de-
tection problem, with the platform independent model based
on social interaction structure. Then we raise a novel interac-
tion entropy algorithm to depict the interaction activity. The
experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method
on two real-world datasets.
