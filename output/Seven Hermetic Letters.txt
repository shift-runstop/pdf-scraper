Introduction
In the appendix to the first edition of Franz Bardon's
novelized
autobiography, Frabato The Magician,
the reader will find ex-
cerpts from Dr. Georg Lomer's work.
At that time it was not known to the publisher that the ma-
terial published under the title of "High Magic" was in fact the
work of Dr. Lomer. The manuscripts
included no reference
to
this author, and though his name was contained
in the Czech
translation,
this was not known to the original
German
pub-
lisher until recently. It is, however, important to note that Bar-
don considered
Dr. Lomer's
instructions
to be of great value,
otherwise he would not have had them translated into Czech for
the benefit of his students.
Dr. Lomer's
Seven
Hermetic
Letters
belong,
without
a
doubt, among the most valuable magical
treatises
of the 20th
century. We are pleased that we have been given the opportu-
nity to publish this book. The original title contained the words
"secret
science,"
which,
since the publication
of the Bardon
books, have lost their earlier significance.
We are aware that many students do not adhere strictly to
the instructions
of the masters, and do their exercises aimlessly
without
giving any serious thought
to the consequences.
We
would like to briefly address the dangers to which the student
subjects
himself
when he makes improper
use of the magic
sciences.
In paragraph
7 of the Fifth Letter of this book, Dr.
Lomer
recommends
exercises
whereby
the consciousness
is
transferred
into the feet and other parts of the body. For those
who have reached the "magical equilibriun"
in accordance
with
the instructions
given in Bardon's
Initiation
Into Hermetics,
these exercises
are not harmful. However, without this magical
11
equilibrium
the student
subjects
himself
to certain
dangers,
concerning
which Bardon
warns us in The Key To The True
Kabbalah, pp. 55-58 (1996 edition).
In these days, self-cognition
is not much in demand; that is
why the strictness of Dr. Lomer's
instructions
may touch some
readers
unpleasantly.
But whosoever
has the strong wish for
spiritual
perfection
will not be discouraged.
The exercises
of
spiritual,
astral and physical asceticism
are intended to serve a
higher purpose, rather than one's own selfish desires. We like
to compare the ascetic to a competitive
athlete who must im-
pose upon himself a certain rigorous
lifestyle
if he wishes to
unfold his entire energy during competition.
The
ascetic
exercises
serve,
among
other
things,
to
strengthen the will power and harmonize the astral, whereby the
main emphasis is to be placed upon thought control and charac-
ter training.
When it comes to character
training,
we recom-
mend following the example of the four elements as described
in Bardon's
Initiation
Into Hermetics.
Not only must one carry
out quite a bit of detail work upon the path to a "magical equi-
librium," but one must also pass many examinations,
for which
courage and good psychic or astral stability are required.
Dr. Georg Lomer was born on September
12, 1877 in Loos-
ten near Wismar and died in 1957. The original issue of these
letters seems to have originated in the 1920s or 1930s; unfortu-
nately, Lomer's
writings do not contain any dates, whether of
the day, month or year.
We wish all students
of the spiritual
sciences
enjoyment
and success during their studies and practice.

FIRST
LETTER
RISE UP AND
BECOME
LIGHT
Introduction
My dear reader, these letters should teach you to recognize,
to
awaken, to develop and to use your finer, higher, secret powers.
The "natural" human being, one who is neither quick-witted
nor
awake, can be compared to a rock which has not yet been struck
by the rod to bring forth the living water. For some, adverse
experiences
and life catastrophes
serve as such a rod. Others
have good powers of observation
-
they immerse themselves
by contemplating
the circumstances
which everyday
life pre-
sents to them and, on a long-term basis, contemplate
the destiny
of other people as well. Sooner or later this will bring about an
awakening. Many, however, retain until their physical death the
childish
opinion
that
human
beings
are nothing
more
than
highly developed animals, and that their task and purpose is ex-
hausted with eating, drinking, procreation
and conducting
busi-
ness.
The
line between
animal
and
human
being,
my dear
reader, runs in reality right through the middle of present-day
humankind.
All you have to do is look around, and you will find this
premise confirmed. You will see foxes and jackals, vultures and
peacocks,
predators
and cows, but only a few human beings.
You will see these animals with all their animal instincts, at all
levels
of
society,
in all
professions;
there
is no
external
division.
At times you see these animals in positions
of honor
13
and power; knowing this, you will no longer be surprised
why
so many judicial and business practices resemble a criminal plot
or conspiracy,
and why "high politics"
resembles
a madhouse.
Examine the motives and you will find the animal.
Let these letters have an effect on you. Perhaps they will
serve the purpose of being an awakening rod, striking your heart
to open the door to the higher, the "actual,"
human being. I do
not demand that you believe something because of my mere as-
surance.
Your intellect
was bestowed
upon you so that you
might make use of it. You have the right, in every respect,
to
know "why" when it comes to the advice and recommendations
given in these letters.
It is, however, necessary that we proceed on a common ba-
sis. Archimedes
said: "Give me a point in the universe where I
can stand, and I will lift the earth out of its hinges!" Therefore,
we require a firm point of departure
in order to walk together
and reach our goal. If you consider a certain color blue while I
consider it green, we shall never agree; should we want to pur-
chase something green, you would not understand
my proposal
nor would you accept it. Of course, the subject matter we are
dealing
with here is much more important
than the mere pur-
chase of a meaningless green substance.
Therefore
let us consider the following,
and then you may
decide if you agree with my representation.
This is absolutely
necessary
as far as the principal
theme is concerned.
At this
point, do not concern yourself with minor details in respect to
the expression of words.
If I have a table in front of me, I know that the table did not
come into being by itself. A carpenter or cabinet maker, a man
who had the ability to make such a table, must have made it.
When I look at a piece of art, for instance
a painting,
I know
14
that the painting
did not come into being by itself
but was
painted by a creative artist.
When I look at the world as a whole, I say to myself: The
world cannot have come into existence by itself; there must be
~,
something
that originally
made it or created
it, just
as the
mechanism of a clock leads to the conclusion that a watchmaker
made it. Therefore
the wonderfully
moving
organism
of the
whole universe must lead to the conclusion that there is a foun-
der of this universe
and someone who keeps it moving.
It is
completely
unimportant
as to whether we imagine this "some-
thing" to be essential
or personal. Under any circumstances,
it
has to be something which is greater and more powerful than all
"matter,"
or a person greater and more powerful than all "per-
sons." The artist as such stands always above the art.
If we agree
that this creative,
forming
and preserving
power -
and under certain circumstances
a destructive
power
as well -
is a "spirit,"
then we have found our common de-
nominator.
It is obvious that this spirit which created and controls the
universe must be present in every single one of His creations.
He keeps them alive continuously
and reveals Himself and His
lawfulness
through their mediatorship.
Instead of speaking
of
the "wisdom of our body," like many of the new age scientists
do, we should rather speak of the "wisdom in our body." When
I hear a piece of music, I do not praise the beauty of the piano
keys, but the ability of the pianist, who only makes use of the
keys in order to express his intentions. These intentions consist
of the bringing
forth
and articulation
of certain
harmonies,
rhythmically
harmonizing
together, which cause your inner de-
light and mine. No listener or connoisseur
of music doubts this.
15
Apply
this
allegory
to your
whole
organism.
Here
the
player, the spirit, wants harmony. The heart beats, the lungs la-
bor, the blood corpuscles race through the vessels in accordance
with rhythmic
laws which your conscious
will did not give
them. Your entire conduct of life, your life's
schedule,
takes
place in a certain rhythm -
sleeping and waking, youth and old
age, etc. -
which was not determined
by your conscious
will.
Yes, even your outward destiny, when you have learned to see
it, shows an unmistakable
rhythm, ebb and tide, recurrent
ex-
periences and forms or shapes. In short, your entire existence is
integrated
into the wheel of all the occurrences
in the entire
universe, in the living "breath of God," without any conscious
action on your part, many times even without
your knowing
anything about it. However, there is one most important excep-
tion:
As soon as you consciously
or unconsciously
violate the
laws of harmony that rule the occurrences
in the universe, such
as
not
treating
your
body
properly,
committing
violations
against a group of human beings of which you are part or into
which you are integrated, or crimes and so on, you yourself will
have to carry the often embarrassing
consequences.
You will
carry them in the form of ailments, external conflicts, and catas-
trophes in your life.
This great law of cause and effect rules inexorably
and in-
corruptibly.
You can only reconcile
it with your separate exis-
tence when you recognize it and apply it consciously to yourself
and your life. The spirit that created and formed you knows why
you should serve Him. Does not every watchmaker
know his
work, and did he not assign a certain role for every wheel in the
whole scope of things? It is your task to find out, to feel out as
well as you can, your intended purpose, in order to enlist your
16
whole life into the service of this leading thought
which was
placed within you. Only the horse that jumps over the hurdle
placed in front of him no longer requires the whip.
Every machine has its control, and that applies also to your
own organism -
that is to be understood
in the broadest sense.
Any machine
has a particular
control for each of its various
main purposes and it is necessary to know them so that in every
instance you can properly operate them.
First, a few words about the structure of matter. If you as-
sume that matter
consists
of electrons,
the basic element
of
electricity,
then you will have approximately
the right
idea.
Every
atom of an element
consists
of one positive
nucleus,
which is orbited in ellipses by negatively charged electrons. The
nucleus is the sun; the orbiting electrons
are the planets.
It is
therefore
a planetary
system
on a small scale.
Your visible
body, which consists of billions of atoms, is therefore a cosmos,
which is held together and controlled by a unified will. The vi-
brations of the planets in this cosmos are relatively slow -
that
is why they are perceptible
to the simple senses.
In order to comfortably
equilibrate
the disturbances
in this
artful organization,
the regulating
spirit created a model in ac-
cordance
with the manner of an artist which is incorporated
with the physical body; but the fluid or subtle body, the second
body
of a human
being,
is invisible
under
normal
circum-
stances. This body also consists of electrons, but they orbit con-
siderably faster around their sun centers. Both bodies are held
together by electromagnetic
powers.
Under
certain
circumstances
this
fluid
body
can
(after
death) leave the physical
body wholly or in part and become
visible to clairvoyant
human beings (appearances
of phantoms
and apparitions
etc.). In rare instances
it can also happen that,
17
through a process of condensation,
this body can become visible
and tangible to the physical senses. This has been observed and
photographically
documented
by scientists
such
as Dr.
von
Schrenk-Notzing,
Dr.
Grunewald,
and
Dr.
Geley.
These
appearances
of partial fluid members of the body and of whole
figures
were
produced
with
the
help
of
mediums.
Their
telekinetic manifestations
are transformations
of the subtle body
that has left the physical body. Such a separation of both bodies
always causes some harm, even if only temporarily,
to the state
of health of the particular medium. The peculiar symptoms, like
labor pains, which accompany this separation
process, and the
sometimes
severe state of exhaustion,
are proof of this. These
things can only be accomplished
through an at least partial loss
of consciousness;
in other words, it occurs in a state of trance.
This leads to the conclusion
that our consciousness
is based
upon the cooperation
of both bodies. Not until this cooperation
takes place will the organs of the senses be activated, and these
sensory organs allow human beings to enter into communication
with the outer world.
The
communication
cable,
the
soldering
joint
of both
power systems, is the sympathetic nervous system, a highly im-
portant,
independent
nerve center, and its main ganglia is lo-
cated behind the abdominal organs.
The fluid body lives by itself in the kingdom of the subcon-
scious, as it manifests itself in many dreams. Subconsciousness
is the lens through which a human being can symbolically
per-
ceive events which otherwise
remain hidden from a person's
sensory perception.
On the lower development
levels, this abil-
ity of perception
is limited to corporal functional
disturbances
and the like. On the higher development
levels, however,
the
18
fluid body can become a valuable intermediary
of extra-sensory
cognizance of events, and many other things.
The fluid body does not possess its own will, but rather it
obeys any influence that orders it, provided this influence exerts
enough force. This influence can either originate from the indi-
vidual
himself
or from another
person,
for instance
through
suggestion
or hypnosis wherein, through other activities
of the
senses, the attention of the person to be hypnotized
is diverted
and the will and concepts of the hypnotist take the place of his
own.
From whence does the will, which usually makes its effects
known in both our bodies,
the coarser and the finer, take its
nourishment?
The more a human being finds himself in an ani-
malistic, original state, the more can the motor of all his actions
be found in instinctiveness.
The instinct
for self-preservation,
the sexual urges (hunger and love), and all the passionate
ten-
dencies connected
with these urges, control the elementary
hu-
man being, which of course in the higher sense cannot actually
be called
a "human
being."
They are enormously
powerful
forces,
and their main carriers
in the body are the red blood
corpuscles
which are charged with tremendous
electrical
ener-
gies. The genital glands or gonads -
the male testicles and fe-
male ovaries -
are the principal
storage areas. The lower the
level upon which a human being stands, the more unrestrained
is the control of these primitive instincts over such a human be-
ing. And even what we proudly consider to be the "intellect"
is
for the most part in the service of primitive instinct.
The glutton and the drinker who misuse their minds to find
ever new delicacies
to tickle their palates; and the lecher who
lives only for sexual desire -
what are they? They are merely
servants of their blood; they stoke a fire which will eventually
19
destroy them. The "profiteer"
or "businessman"
who consider
such activity to be the purpose of life, and who sees his entir
destiny in the accumulation
of material objects, in the end con
demns himself to death with these transitory
things. This well
known phrase "Making Money," written with capital letters, is
nothing
more than extended
gluttony!
In addition,
it is some
thing with which a human being can thoroughly upset his stom
ach. The intellectual
power which he sacrifices for these thing:
must therefore be considered
as the lower or elementary
powe
of thinking.
You must also know that thinking is an electrical procedun
which occurs in a plastic, exceedingly
fine substance, a modifi-
cation of ether. It is important to these lessons to realize that all
thought forms and imagery which serve the instinct in both the
narrower and wider sense are formed out of this very important
energy substance.
These thought forms are lower thinking,
and
are directed only towards the coarsest interests of the thinker.
We will once more summarize all four things:
1. The coarse, physical body.
2. The subtle, fluid body.
3. The power of the instinctual life.
4. The lower power of thinking.
Here we have before
us the powers
that work together,
the
lower quadruplicity,
of which the last three components
form
the soul of a human being in its mortal parts.
Dear reader, it is absolutely
necessary
to commit this ex-
actly to your memory, because it is the foundation of our future
undertakings.
20
Do not forget
that this part of the soul, the organizing
principle
in us, does not possess a conscious
immortality.
This
part of the soul serves the worldly life exclusively,
and as soon
as this life comes to an end, it no longer requires
a control
center
to control
it. If your entire
"I" rises
in the narrow
interests of your own person, then by necessity it will also fall.
This then is the significance
of this sentence:
"For whosoever
will save his life shall lose it."
We must also think of the ending of this verse in the Bible:
"And whosoever
will lose his life for My sake shall find it."
What does "for My sake" mean?!
You must understand that the spirit did not create a human
being for himself alone. He placed the human being under thou-
sands of other beings,
so that he could recognize,
out of the
multitude, a higher unity under whose order he, as a special be-
ing, must fulfill particular
tasks in order to consciously
return,
eventually,
to the lap of unity when the task has been fulfilled.
Standing amidst visible and invisible crossings of energy in an
immense cosmos, a compass is required to find your way. And
this compass is given to a person in the form of the higher eter-
nal part of his being.
If he lives in the world of the senses with his physical body
and fluid body -
provided it is not developed in the lower as-
tral sphere of the subconscious -
then a person has, above and
beyond that, the possibility
to ascend, here as well as in the be-
yond, to higher spheres of life and activity by means of higher
centers of energy which are given to him. These are the centers
that bring him into contact with the soul of the nations, races,
and humanity, and eventually
with the world soul. Centers that
are within him are only present as an embryo, and in most hu-
man beings they are only developed to the minutest extent. The
21
majority of human beings are not even aware of their existence
and they may well allow an aptitude to atrophy which consti-
tutes their actual higher human value.
In the principle
of thinking,
in the power of thinking,
we
find the bridge to this higher and finer essence of our being. It
expresses
itself as higher, more abstract thinking,
as objective
self-knowledge,
moral will, spiritual productive powers of crea-
tion, intuition and conscience.
Within
the being
of this power
of thinking
a higher
1-
consciousness
lies enclosed which is far above the more animal-
istic I-consciousness
of the lower quadruplicity
and which takes
the first step into the super-ego.
Way above this quality of thinking lies the phase of pure
illumination
-
a level of consciousness
which was present in
Christ and which will be awakened in those who are on the path
of Hermetics. With this, an expansion of perception
and knowl-
edge is given which is based on the quickest vibrations
of the
prime matter of ether and is rooted in the ability of "vision" -
which raises the human being above the bounds of the narrow,
fatal "personality"
and allows him to participate
in the spheres
of activity
which elevate him into the circle of the so-called
"gods."
Here we are dealing with the activation of the divine genius
which lies latent in all of us. Higher thinking and illumination
are the steps which lead to the divine genius. These two quali-
ties of consciousness
can be signified as the purest emanations
of the highest and seventh principle
within us, namely cosmic
consciousness;
all together
they form the higher
triplicity
in
human beings. This divine genius has its point of contact in a
particular
central point of the brain. The best way to imagine
this point is in the center of the head. The divine genius is the
22
actual regent of your destiny; it puts you in the place where you
belong
and where you should
gather
certain
experiences;
it
trains you for particular
tasks which you must fulfill through
pain and suffering
and which will change in every new life.
This divine
genius warns you and is your infallible
advisor,
when you have learned to listen to him. He will give the pro-
foundest happiness
and peace to your soul, as soon as the soul
has subjected herself to his guidance. He is the immortal within
you, the "Son of God" who can say of himself and with full jus-
tification: "Behold, I and my Father are one!"
Setting Goals
And now, my dear reader -
our goal! What do you expect from
these instructions?
Answer this question for yourself, but do it
conscientiously.
Do you expect worldly advantages that are easily obtained,
which give you priority over your fellow man without making
any high demands upon yourself? Do you want to shine through
secret abilities
which will place others at a disadvantage
but
into your favor? Do you want to receive
valuable
goods, but
without being prepared to sacrifice for them? Then these letters
were not written
for you. Leave
them be, and pursue
your
pleasures.
Know that the value that these letters conceal
cannot be
bought or sold; you have to work for it, and become these valu-
able things yourself. The path to the grail passes over the dead
body of your old "1." Whosoever would be born again must first
learn how to die. Are you prepared?
Have. you heard this call-
ing? Examine yourself! You are dealing with serious things.
23
This course of instruction intends nothing less than to make
the God-man conscious within you and to make him the Lord of
your life! This is not something which can be obtained through
thinking
and studying.
The keenest
intellect
cannot
capture
what you must experience
in your Innermost
as a process
of
transformation
-
an experience
with all the horror of a new
birth. ("Except ye be converted, and become as little children.")
The higher trinity (the symbol for the higher trinity
is a
right-angled
triangle) should therefore be brought into the lower
quadruplicity
(symbolized
by the quadrangle)
for revelation.
The higher triplicity
should allow the "perishable"
mortal part-
ner to participate
in its own omniscience,
omnipresence
and
eternity. The higher trinity should transfigure
the soul, and be-
come more identical in character and help the soul achieve con-
scious immortality
and the degree of omnipotence
of which she
is worthy. The richer, the more highly developed
the vessel of
the spirit is, the greater the might which he is capable of exert-
ing on this basis upon a low, most imperfect form of crystalliza-
tion, the coarse matter. The intended process of transformation
is connected to this fact, of which we spoke earlier.
The Procedure
In the kingdom of the spirit there exists a law: Same can only be
understood
by same. Every difference
is merely a difference
in
vibration.
The coarsest
and slowest vibrations
of the primary
matter which form all things show themselves
in the substance
of a human being, the physical
body. The fluid body is finer
than the physical
body, yet the higher
self is the finest;
and
subtle
beyond
all concepts
is the
vibration
of the
cosmic
24
consciousness,
about which an ancient proverb speaks: "God is
a consuming fire."
In order to become more receptive to the influences
of the
divine genius, the lower "I" must be systematically
upwardly
purified and brought to higher vibrations;
in short, it must be-
come more refined. Only when the bride is ready will the bride-
groom come.
The success of that endeavor
depends
upon the personal
aptitude
of the student; it will depend especially
on his inner
honesty and uprightness
(because "many are called, but few are
chosen !"). Furthermore,
it also depends
on his perseverance,
because every organic process of development requires a certain
time to mature. And, finally, it depends upon the "blessing"
and
the "love from above." The genius cannot be forced downward
into every vessel; instead, he selects his own place.
The metaphysical
kingdoms are not without dangers. Who-
soever is not in possession of purity and perfection will not find
the entrance to this kingdom. In spite of searching,
he will not
be admitted.
However, any aspirant can achieve this, no matter what his
circumstances;
it constitutes
a degree of self-mastery
and con-
trol over one's
own destiny which raises a person
above the
crowd as a noble champion for life. Certainly
this one goal is
worth the effort of the noble.
The
erring
ways
of
a
self-indulgent
age
begin
with
mastering life from the wrong end. One wants to live like a lord,
a life of luxury wherein all passions
are completely
satisfied
and life is enjoyed
to the fullest.
One wants to dominate
the
world -
in other words, other human beings -
before one has
learned to master or control himself. The results are that those
"masters"
who make fools of themselves
are fools in the spirit
25
and,
because
of inner
insurmountable
weaknesses,
stumble
again and again through the course of their lives as soon as they
are attacked where they are vulnerable -
in their animal souls.
In reality, being a master begins without exception with the
mastery of your 9wn person. We are given the microcosm,
the
"small world"; that we learn from it is our first example,
our
first assignment.
And unless this assignment
is satisfactorily
solved, we grasp in vain for higher goals.
Balance
and Transformation
Before
we turn
to the practice,
let us be very
clear
about
two
main points.
(1) Speak to no one, whoever it may be, about your inten-
tions, not to mention the details of these procedures.
By so do
ing, you expend currents
of energy which you should instead
gather for yourself. The possibility
also exists that you will di
rect hostile counter-currents
towards yourself which will harn
you and jeopardize
your intention or plans. Do not even speal
to your wife or close friends about this.
(2) Be absolutely
honest and candid with yourself.
If you
fool yourself
or extenuate
what is embarrassing
for you, then
you deceive yourself and you will not be able to reach even the
closest goal. The energies you want to work with will answer
you in the same manner as you ask. If the question
you ask is
dishonest
or untruthful,
the answer will be in accordance.
You
cannot build a house on quicksand.
26
You can begin at any time. Any minute can be the begin-
ning of a new life. Be completely
clear about this: These in-
structions are not something
to mock, but will re-orient
your
entire life towards a particular, purposeful direction.
Once you have begun, you should not interrupt this course
of instruction
except when you are forced by illness to do so.
Should you interrupt
this course, you will suffer a severe set-
back, much more than you might believe, and you will lose the
advantage
which was so difficult to attain and which can only
be regained
with a very great effort. You lose a considerable
amount of time and sacrifice your energy for nought.
Now that we have explained these important points, let us
begin with the practice. This course of instruction
is structured
in a sequence
of levels which must be followed
one after the
other. Every level is estimated
to take one month, but can be
extended at one's discretion if necessary. In other words: Every
level must be properly completed, completely
finished,
studied
and practiced
thoroughly,
internally
digested,
before
you can
begin with the next level. Otherwise you will build a structure
which is not solid and which will fall apart in days to come.
There
is no self-schooling
without
self-cognizance.
The
heading of Step 1 reads as follows: balance and transformation.
You should take stock of your entire life up to now; with
that, a new phase of your life begins. Observe the following
fundamental rules.

Practical
Exercises
For
The First Month
Here you have two negative exercises (what you should not do)
and five positive exercises (what you should do). Act in accor-
dance with the following
explanations.
It is absolutely
neces-
sary
to
deprive
yourself
of those
things
mentioned
above
throughout the entire course of instruction, because:
(1) Both body and spirit are connected
and influence
each
other. They must be thoroughly
detoxified,
because a cleansed
will can only grow in a cleansed organism. Wine and brandy are
forbidden
from the first day. Should you be addicted
to alco-
holic
beverages,
you can replace
them with beer.
However,
within four weeks you must be entirely off beer as well. Should
you be much addicted to beer, first limit your consumption
to
one half the normal amount; then, after fourteen days, to a quar-
ter, and after three weeks you must totally abstain.
28
(2) Any kind of sexual intercourse
weakens
you; at this
.time you require all your energy for higher purposes. You must
also abstain
from erotic thoughts,
because
these weaken
you
just as much as the actual intercourse;
for some people,
even
more so. Avoid sensuous reading material and conversation;
do
not listen to any obscenities
or stories on the subject.
Should
you experience
nightly seminal discharges
without any action
on your part, do not worry about it. It is the given form by
which nature expels any excess, and, as a rule, only that much is
expelled
as nature can spare. When the number
of such dis-
charges
is
too
great,
the
reason
is
a
pathological
over-
stimulation.
Consider a seminal discharge of two times a week a
healthy limit. Should you exceed this limit, seek medical advice
or try a cool sitz bath before bed to have an effect on the repro-
ductive
centers.
(Most people do not have these frequent
dis-
charges. )
(3) If, for example, you normally rise at 7:00 in the morn-
ing, then rise at 6:55 A.M. on the first day of these exercises,
the next day at 6:50 and so on, 5 minutes earlier every day. In
two weeks you will rise 1 hour and 10 minutes earlier. If neces-
sary, use an alarm clock the first few times. After one week,
make up your mind at bedtime to awaken at the proper time in
the morning. If you have total confidence,
your plan will suc-
ceed immediately the following day. You will make it easier for
yourself to succeed if you go to bed early.
(4) I recommend the following two exercises:
(a) The Pea Exercise:
Take a handful
of peas (preferably
yellow), and scatter them throughout
a room. Then kneel down
29
and gather them on a plate. This has to take place in a very lei-
surely way, without a trace of upset or impatience,
slowly with-
out haste. Should you experience
any indignant emotions,
stop
gathering
the peas immediately
and wait until you have com-
pletely overcome this feeling; then continue to gather. It must
be your goal that such emotions simply do not occur. You have
to eliminate
them before they arise; better yet, make up your
mind from the beginning
not to entertain
these types of emo-
tions.
(b) Sitting Still: Sit on a chair in a quiet room, facing a
clock.
Should
you not have a wall clock available,
place
a
pocket or wrist watch in front of you. Sit erect on the chair in
such a way that you do not touch anything
for support,
then
place your hands on your knees. Fix your eyes upon the watch
without moving a muscle. Pay particular
attention
to the fact
that not one muscle fiber moves or even twitches.
Also, your
torso must remain
completely
motionless.
Attempt
to refrain
from blinking the eyelids; there is no harm done if you should
not be successful immediately.
Begin this exercise for a period of 1 minute, and every sec-
ond day increase it by another minute; in other words, the dura-
tion of the exercise on the third and fourth day is 2 minutes, on
the fifth and sixth day 3 minutes, and so forth. After 14 days
you will have reached a duration of 7 minutes. The best way of
accomplishing
these two exercises is by alternating
every other
day. Today the pea exercise and tomorrow the sitting still exer-
cise. The best time is early in the morning.
(5) The self-criticism
or self-judgment
should be executed
on the basis of a very particular
scrutiny of your present life.
30
You want to ascertain
your wrong-doings.
Sitting down in a
very quiet place, contemplate
the individual phases of your life.
Scrutinize
one period after another. Make notes. Consider
the
following main points:
What was your main motive at various stages of your life?
The guideline of your decisions? When did you act badly or ma-
levolently
towards your parents, teachers, brothers
and sisters,
acquaintances,
relatives,
superiors,
authorities?
Answer
one
point after the other. Call everything by its rightful name -
do
not spare yourself anything. The only things to be considered
are your faults or shortcomings.
Should you not find any, reflect
again. You must have made some errors,
because
no one is
without fault. Attempt to recognize
the consequences,
both to
yourself
and to others, which were caused by your behavior.
Remind
yourself!
Never pity yourself
falsely!
Do not defend
yourself or make excuses for yourself.
When you have found a number of points, faults or short-
comings, reprimand yourself in a loud and subdued voice, in the
same way that a judge or plaintiff would speak to you. Use se-
vere and harsh expressions
or language.
Deal with another period of your life every day. The old
long-forgotten
things are just as important as the present ones.
Once you have gone through all the periods of your life, begin
again and you will discover more faults in the time frame which
you already covered before.
Dedicate half an hour every day to this exercise;
the best
time is early in the morning, right after the patience
or sitting
still
exercise.
Very
valuable
help
develops
for this
highly
important
task
if
you
obtain
an
impeccable
graphological
character
analysis of your handwriting.
It should be done by a
graphologist
you do not know personally.
Point out to him that
31
it is important to you that he give you a very critical evaluation
of your handwriting,
and that you want everything
exposed,
without
any holding back; you want the true nucleus
of your
character with all its weaknesses.
Should you yourself be experienced
in graphology,
you can
of course analyze yourself, though in order to receive an unbi-
ased evaluation it is much better if someone else does it. Should
you not know a qualified graphologist
you can contact the au-
thor. 1Though this graphological
evaluation is a valuable tool to
apply to oneself, it is not absolutely necessary. You can attempt
to replace it with the following exercise:
Instead of the mirror of your handwriting,
make use of the
mirror of human beings. How are you mirrored or reflected in
the opinion of your fellow man? Begin with your friends and
adversaries.
Scrutinize
one after the other; contemplate
what
they think of you and how they came to that conclusion.
Do not
hide behind the excuse: "How can I know that? !" You do know.
Behind every animosity hides a true cause which you must sift
out. You yourself
initiated
many of the avalanches
that have
caused you great danger. In one instance they may have origi-
nated due to your own lack of control,
while in another they
may have been caused by dubious activities.
Once you have completed
all that, then begin with your
business and professional
acquaintances.
Did some of them not
tell
you
the
truth
at
one
time
or
another?
Perhaps
they
exaggerated.
What you should understand
is the actual point
they were trying to make -
it is a reflection
of yourself. Then
continue with your closest relatives and intimate friends. What
does your brother, your sister, your spouse say about you and

your character?
Look for the flaws and shortcomings
they
find
in
your
character
rather
than
your
characteristics,
which you already know.
Should the need arise, you can always obtain full particu-
lars about yourself, about your character,
and your other habits
by anonymously
contacting a good detective agency or informa-
tion bureau and asking for information about yourself.
Always allow yourself time for all these things. Every day,
deal with some of your shortcomings.
Always record the main
points which you have found, for in the end they will give you a
clear overview.
There is yet another method you can employ as a means for
self-recognition,
and that is your hand. The hand of a human
being is a weather map which clearly shows from which corner
the storms of your life originate.
In its form and in the forma-
tion of the lines of the palm, the hand reflects the danger points
of your development,
the years you have to struggle as well as
the amount of energy that has crystallized
within your person.
You will come into possession
of a clear and exact knowledge
as to where you must place special emphasis in regards to your
self-development.
Should you want to make use of this possibility,
seek out a
good chirologist
(not to be confused with some of the charlatans
who advertise their services). There are some in Germany. Pro-
vide this person with any necessary
documents,
such as palm
and finger prints, also the outer forms of the fingers. A personal
visit is, of course, best.
Before you get into the flow of things in regards to self-
development,
it is necessary
to recognize your
own limits. A
human being can only develop to a certain predetermined
level
in any given lifetime.
which
good
33
Naturally,
you can analyze
and judge
your handwriting
and hand yourself with the help of good books on the subject.
However, the necessary knowledge on these subjects cannot be
gained in a short time. It takes many years of practical
study as
well as a special aptitude in order to become a good grapholo-
gist or palm reader.
(6) Each evening, spend some time alone, if possible
in a
dark room. Recall all the events and experiences
of the day -
the people, the words, the activities.
Ascertain
how successful
you were with today's
exercises
and where you failed,
where
the results were unsatisfactory.
Keep a diary in which you care-
fully and unhurriedly
record the results
of your retrospective
view. If properly done, this systematic self-recognition
and self-
assessment
will take at least a full month. Should you, contrary
to expectations,
finish your retrospection
before the month is
over, repeat the same procedure once more.
Summarize
all your mistakes
and shortcomings
in brief,
poignant
principal
sentences
or key words. Hereupon
make a
plan for the next day. It is best to do this in writing. Make a
note of your intentions to cast off those things which, as far as
you are aware of them, constitute your character flaws the very
next day, and to avoid the mistakes in the future that you made
earlier in your life. Write this down in the form of a command.
(7) Before
you go to bed, cleanse
yourself
with water.
When you wash your upper body and your face, combine your
action
with
the
sharply
defined
idea:
"As
the
water
now
cleanses all the dirt from my physical body, that is how my will
shall cleanse all the dirt from my soul! I progress every day!"
34
It would be very advantageous
to assign a certain hand ges-
ture to the thought, thus helping to remove certain mistakes and
shortcomings
from your character. For example, let us imagine
that you have recognized
that you are inclined towards greed,
that you are not punctual, that you lie, and so on. So when you
wash yourself, think: "With this movement of my hand I elimi-
nate my greed; with this movement of my hand I eliminate
my
tardiness; with this movement of my hand I eliminate my lies!"
In the beginning you must execute this procedure with your
fullest
attention.
However,
after a while this will occur more
mechanically,
which is allowed; to a certain degree, it is even
desired. In this manner you effectively
insert the tendency you
want into the organizing
powers of your Innermost.
The main
point to be made here is that this has to occur on a regular basis.
When you do this, it is important that your thoughts remain with
the subject
at hand; you should not be occupied
with other
thoughts, no matter what they are.
Therefore,
your
daily
schedule
for
the
first
month
of
exercises
is as follows:
In the morning:
Rise in accordance with the instructions
in this chapter.
In the forenoon:
Alternate the two patience exercises and self-judgment.
In the evening:
Practice criticism of the day, make plans for the following
day, and cleanse yourself with water.
Once the month has passed, ask yourself whether you have
reached your goal as set out in the instructions.
Should you not
35
have done so, then continue with these exercises until you have
achieved your goals. Only then can you continue with the sec-
ond level; otherwise, it will not serve your purpose because you
will not succeed.
SECOND
LETTER
RISE UP AND BECOME
LIGHT
Your Special Mission
When you, my friend and student, have thoroughly
studied and
practiced
the First Letter completely,
you will have achieved
two things. First, you will have a clear picture
of your own
character
and its shortcomings,
and secondly
you will have
made the first
step toward
correcting
and eliminating
those
shortcomings.
In other words, you will have begun to see your-
self as the spirit sees you in order to acquire an insight into your
intention, your purpose, and to bring yourself into line with this
intention. Be convinced that the spirit has a special purpose for
you which no one but you can fulfill. You were created espe-
cially for this task by the spirit. The spirit would not have led
you to certain places, would not have had you meet certain peo-
pIe, if such an intent did not exist.
Your task may have an insignificant
outer appearance;  it
can take place in the framework
of meaningless
professional
duties, or by carrying out seemingly unimportant chores. It is up
to you to carry out these tasks with all your love under any cir-
cumstances.
You can be certain, especially
now, that they are
the right thing for your inner growth and maturity.
Once you
have outgrown
this, you will be summoned
to tackle another
36
task. The reason why many human beings do not progress
is
that they want to skip a grade, or want to withdraw from it, be-
fore they are mature enough for the next grade.
Life consists of the premise that you learn your lessons one
level at a time. Whoever does not take this seriously but smiles
at it arrogantly
will sooner or later be brought back onto the
proper path through severe experiences
and adversity -
many,
of course, not until they are on their death bed.
In this sense there is no "lower" or "higher"
work. Wher-
ever you are, do your duty with joy and total devotion;
that is
how you earn your patent of nobility, which opens the door to
the next echelon of the spirit.
The Monitory
Letter
Now that you have recognized
your shortcomings
and know
where to apply the lever in order to make a perfect tool out of
yourself, summarize the essence of the knowledge you have at-
..tained in a few short efficient sentences and place them in your
vicinity
in such a way that you are constantly
and repeatedly
reminded of them. Write sentences such as "Learn to be silent,"
"Remain calm," "Be patient," etc. Write this on a small piece of
paper and place it on your desk, your book shelf, or anyplace
that often catches your eye. Write these words very clearly with
ink or a colored pen or pencil. Cut this paper and give it a par-
ticular shape, i.e., round.
Should this be too conspicuous,
abbreviate the sentence or
write only the first letter of each word. Should this still be too
conspicuous,
then use any symbol at your discretion,
i.e. a pen-
tagram, and, when you draw it, think intensively
about the sen-
tence which you wish to commit to the paper and about which
37
you want to be admonished. Whenever you look upon this piece
of paper, you will consciously
or unconsciously
receive an im-
pulse which will guide you into the desired direction.
Here the
same principle is applied as in advertising.
If you read the same
advertisement
a hundred times in many media, then the hundred
and first time you might go and buy that particular
product,
even though originally
you had no intention
of buying it. You
are in a store and you think about something entirely different;
you are undecided. Then the automatically
accepted impression
announces itself as a desire, an urge. You obey the impulse and
you do not know why you acted in this manner or how it came
about.
The Make-Over
Of
Your Character
The aforementioned
method is a good aid to create positive new
habits. Whosoever
wants to make over his character,
to rebuild
it -
which is what you want -
must put good new habits in
place of the bad old ones. That which is called "character"
is a
conglomerate
of certain deep-rooted
habits. Therefore,
"He has
a good character"
means "He has good habits!" All habits can
be traced back to right or wrong thinking;
they are therefore
habits of thinking. Now we have reached the fundamental
sig-
nificance of thinking for our entire lives, endeavors and destiny.
Thinking:
"Blessed
Electricity"
In the First Letter you learned about the inner structure
of the
human organism.
You know that the human organism consists
of various electrical
systems which interlink
and form a unity
38
for the duration of this physical life. Picture it in the shape of a
pyramid;
its apex represents
the immortal
trinity and its base
the mortal quadruplicity.
From the apex to the base, the inner
structure becomes coarser and the oscillations
of the prime ele-
ment slow down.
All systems are in contact with one another and constantly
exchange multitudes
of electrons.
It is the purpose of these in-
structions
to help the higher, differentiated,
more finely built
and more quickly vibrating electrons
of the higher systems to
attain control over lower electrons of the lower systems so that
the eternal being can be victorious over the mortal being. Only
in so far as this is successful can a mortal partake in the might
and splendor of the immortal. The element of power, which is
the carrier of this exchange and which we have to make use of
in this endeavor,
is thought. All spiritual
exchange
of liquids
becomes conscious in this thought; it is, so to speak, the inside,
the inner aspect of our vital electricity.
Only through thought
can our higher will gain influence over the lower centers.
Thought:
An Energy System
On A Small Scale
Impress upon yourself that thoughts are real things formed out
of an etheric, extremely plastic fine substance. All imagination,
ideas and concepts are formed out of this fine substance.
They
are the archetypes of all things. Everything visible has its origin
in these archetypes.
Examine the works made by human hands:
hou~es, machines,
airplanes,
steamships,
railroads,
inventions
of all kinds, entire cities, yes, even countries. Before they came
into
being
externally,
they
had to be created
internally
in
thought. First a thing is thought of, and then it is made.
39
Thought is therefore the prime deed which is formed first,
and anything further is formed accordingly.
What an immense
creative
power
is inherent
in the act of thinking!
Thinking
means to create.
Every Thought
Wants To
Become
A Reality
It is a fact which can be proven that every thought
which is
thought of with some attentiveness
has the tendency to become
reality. Stand at the edge of a high cliff and think that you could
fall -
if you do, you are already halfway down. The though1
was sufficient
to give your body muscles the impetus
to fall:
instinctively,
you will hold on to something. Walk into a hospi.
tal room where every patient is afflicted
with cholera;
if you
have the firm conviction
that you are immune against this dis-
ease, you will be safe. Your thought has conferred to every cell
of your body the strongest powers of resistance.
The stutterer stammers because he is constantly
tormented
by the fear of it; this means he cannot get rid of the thought of
stuttering.
The saints got their "stigmata,"
the nail marks of
Christ, because their entire thinking was permeated by the Pas-
sion of Christ. Or when a pregnant woman is witness to certain
horrible events, such as a soldier's hand being cut off in a fight,
her child may be born prematurely with only one hand. Another
woman sees a friend day after day whose hand, due to an acci-
dent, has taken the appearance
of a claw, and she is upset over
it. And her child comes into this world with a hand similar to a
claw.
40
Death Through The Effects
Of Thoughts
Even death can be caused purely through the effects of thought.
Well-known
is the case of a Paris criminal who was sentenced
to death but became the object of the following experiment.
He
was told that, as a special favor, he could choose between dying
peacefully
in his cell through blood-letting
or execution
on the
gallows. He was undressed, blindfolded
and tied to a bench. His
back was lightly scratched with a needle, upon which warm wa-
ter was poured over his back. In forty minutes
the man was
dead.
Students
wanted to play a
prank on an unpopular janitor.
They disguised themselves, seized him, and hauled him before a
Vehmgericht,
a court, which sentenced him to death. They had
 the executioner's
axe and block available.
He was blindfolded
and tied to the block, and the sentence was carried out; that is,
tthe executioner
hit him with a wet towel over his bare neck.
~
When they untied the man, he was dead. The thought that the
execution was real had killed him.
No one has the right, as so often happens, to scoff at such a
respectable
power as the power of the imagination.
There would
be no single achievement
or work of human hands without the
power of the imagination!
You yourself unknowingly
work with this power every day.
Every feature or line on your face is formed by your power of
thought. What you think day by day, the way you think, your
habits or train of thought leave their signs on your face as a
symbol of your character,
clearly readable to a good psycholo-
gist. Show me what you look like, and I will tell you who you
are.
41
It is therefore not unimportant
what kinds of thoughts ym
harbor within yourself, that is, the thoughts you think into you
organism every day. You now hold a great degree of sickness
and health in your own hands, concerning
which you formerly
had merely an idea. Be mindful that annoyances
spoil your ap-
petite, sorrow causes heart ailments, and annoyances that repeat
themselves
affect the liver. In many instances, even cancer can
be traced back to continued worries and fearfulness
or anxiety.
You have it within your power to control the kind of thought
currents,
whether constructive
or destructive,
which you allow
to affect you. Is it not time that you learn to know the mechan-
ics of this immense power in detail?
The Building
Blocks
Of Thinking
The thinking human being is therefore,
consciously
or unconc-
sciously,
a mighty master-builder
who must know how, with
skillful hand, to make use of the building blocks of his thoughts
if he wants to avoid failures or even cause his house to collapse.
The least you should expect is that you must thoroughly
know
these, your own building blocks. Every thought is a picture of a
concept, a model made of a plastic fine substance,
and the real
picture forms itself in accordance with this fine substance out of
coarse matter. In just the same way, we possess a fluid model
body after which the physical body was formed. In a thought we
therefore
have before us the next finest element,
which influ-
ences, guides and forms again the fluid body.
We are dealing here with pictures, essentially entirely opti-
cal pictures,
that is, visual pictures.
It is in these pictures that
the whole of our act of thinking takes place. All our thinking is
a sequence of pictures which together result in an action.
42
These actions of thought are the first act or deed, and eve-
ryone
should
be conscious
of this
responsibility
which
he
shoulders
with the deeds that he thinks about. Inevitably
he is
setting powers into motion; in most instances he no longer has
the power to stop or impede them. If he thinks evil, then the evil
has been accepted by the world of effects and somehow, some-
where, it will take on shape and form. It may be that he who
thought this evil adopts it himself as an evil habit of thinking,
and sooner or later the visible act will follow, or it may happen
that the engendered thought picture will influence one person or
several
others
and they will eventually
carry
out this deed.
However, every deed or work that has been carried out eventu-
ally comes back to the original perpetrator,
because the world is
a closed circle and a human being is a marksman who, mostly
without knowing it, shoots all of his arrows, be they good or
evil, at himself. In the future be mindful of this with each of
your thoughts.
The aforementioned
exemplifies
how important
it is to
make this enormous world-power
subservient
to oneself. In or-
der to achieve this, you must, to begin with, know the source of
this world-power.
Only then can you seize it and purposefully
instruct and increase it, and eventually make use of it in accor-
dance with the will of your higher self.
The Energy Sources Of Thoughts
We will begin this chapter by mentioning
the most important
matter first: The principal energy sources of thoughts are your
own wishes and desires. These are the motors which create infi-
nite sequences of pictures, and place them before your spiritual
eye so that you act in accordance
with this enticement.
Should
43
you follow suit, then at that moment the entire tension of energy
that is produced
is extinguished,
equilibrated,
and it escapes
you. Any excitement
or tension that is connected
to a wish en-
deavors to influence
you to satisfy it, and thus cause it to dis-
charge by some kind of outward
action. A wish is blind and
does not want to serve you; instead it wants to serve itself ex-
clusively. Should you let the wish have its will, then the electri-
cal energy which is stored up in that wish finds its discharge
through this, similar to lightning that strikes the earth. Have we
not learned how to tame this lightning
so that it can carry out
productive work?
The Power Of Wishing
-
Your Motor
You should learn to control this power of wishing, so that it can
serve your higher purposes. Be glad if you are endowed with
passionate
temperament
and a strong desire. Be glad about the
elementary
energy which is contained
within you; it is the dy-
namo whose current will help you ascend, to be born again in
the spirit and in truth. It is a fact that every wish you conquer -
no matter what manner of wish it may be -
makes you  master
over yourself and thereby master of your destiny. Every ascent
begins with the ability to "deny yourself something."
And every
fall begins
with the loss of self-control.
Therefore
you must
walk this path if you are in the least serious about this disci-
pline. The strongest special motor that is built within you is the
sexual sphere. In this regard, a few particular words are of abso-
lute necessity.
44
The Upper And Lower Light
The creative
prime fire is located in two lights or poles sub-
merged in the human being. The upper pole is the divine genius
and has its seat in the brain. Nowadays, this upper pole is pre-
ponderantly
undeveloped
in most human beings. The lower pole
is the sexual energy or power and it has its seat in the loins. It is
very active and is the source of most of our wishes.
Between these two poles there is a lively and significant
exchange of energy. The barometer of this exchange is thinking.
The more productive
the lower pole is, the more it links its en-
ergies with the outside and the less energy is delivered
to the
function
of thinking.
And, vice versa, the more radically
the
outflow of sexual energy to the outside is denied, the greater the
benefit for the power of thinking.
Sexual energy seeks the immortality
of the race by means
of the propagation
of children.
The genius in a human being
seeks his individual
awakening for the purpose of a conscious
immortality.
And this purpose requires
the enormous
energies
that are stored in the sexual center. Since both the sexual energy
and the genius are in a reciprocal
relationship
towards
each
other, the attainment
of the conscious
immortality
of the indi-
vidual depends upon a temporarily
ascetic lifestyle.
The upper
light can only awaken if the lower one lends it its electric ener-
gies. That is why you cannot succeed without absolute control
of the sexual urge.
Natural man lives on the outside, that is, he sees the world
through the veil of his own wishes and desires.
Spiritual
man
lives on the inside, that is, he sees the world without desires,
but with the eyes of the spirit.
45
The Effects Of Asceticism
You have to know all the effects that will follow, and which
you can attain through the discipline of the wish. In general, the
first thing that you experience
will be a noticeable
increase of
energy; you become subjective
as well as objective,
healthier
and more productive.
Your body rejuvenates
in every aspect.
And soon you will also experience
a significant
increase in the
powers of your imagination.
Everything that you think takes on
forms that are more defined and more plastic -
the powers of
imagination
increase. You can think faster and become quicker
in your responses and more versatile.
At the same time, you will observe
that your influence
upon other people is slowly but surely increasing.
It will in-
crease to exactly the same degree as is proportionate
to your
successful
and proper execution
of the exercises
given to you.
In your own interests,
you must be very precise and conscien-
tious. Everyone carries the baton of the spirit in one's knapsack.
We will now begin with the practical exercises of control.
As you know,
they start
with thoughts,
that is, they begin
inwardly and continue outwardly with the entire sphere of life's
activities.
Therefore
the motto for the second level is: Be The
Master In Your Own House.
Be The Master
In Your Own House
Above all, be firm in the knowledge and become accustomed
to
the fact that you and your house are not one and the same. It is a
common expression
to say: "My body, my intellect."
The word
"my" expresses
ownership.
Therefore
there must be an owner
who feels that he is separate from his property or possessions.
46
From now on, rise early in the morning, which, in accor-
dance with the experiences
of the first month, will serve your
purpose best. Then abide by the following rules:
1. Restrict your meat consumption as far as health permits.
2. Wage a daily frontal attack upon all your known weak-
nesses.
3. Practice each muscle-control
exercise daily:
(a) finger stretching exercises;
(b) arm stretching exercises with a glass;
(c) slow walking exercise, step by step.
4. Practice minor concentration
exercises daily.
5. Avoid any unnecessary
expenditure
of energy; maintain
your composure under all circumstances.
6. Practice
daily the accumulation
exercise
wherein
you
practice the denial of wishes.
7. Continue to practice the daily self-criticism
every eve-
ning and the making of plans for the following day.
Explanations
(l)The
consumption
of meat is not desirable
for various
reasons.
It is purchased
through
the death
of a feeling
and
innocent
being,
which
physically
is
comparatively
closely
related to you. Even if you assume that the actual slaughtering
of such an animal is quick and therefore
almost painless,
it is
nevertheless
true that the entire preparation,
the transport,
the
stay at the slaughterhouse,
the blood-curdling
surroundings
and
so on, have an effect upon the animal. It is and remains an act
of barbarism with which you should, if at all possible, avoid any
47
involvement.
Ask yourself
the question:
Would
you eat the
meals you eat if you had to slaughter the animal yourself?
With the animal blood, you also absorb the organic carrier
of the animal's
passions and uncontrolled
desires. A complete
change of animal flesh into human energies is not always suc-
cessful, and not every human being has these capabilities.
It is
well-known
and understandable
that
eating
too
much
meat
causes human beings to be hot-tempered,
sensuous and passion-
ate. This is an obstacle on your chosen path of development.
In this context,
through
experience,
a predominantly
or
purely vegetarian
diet promotes higher abilities
and helps pre-
pare the organic foundation for them. It is important to our pur-
pose that a certain refinement
of the organization
can be better
and more easily obtained by developing the body through vege-
table substances.
As you know, millions of human beings in the
Far East live essentially
without meat. There is certainly
a di-
rect connection
in so far as their gentle disposition
is con-
cerned. They consider the white man on the whole to be aggres-
sive, although he might not think of himself in these terms. The
vibrations of thinking are the ones that are perceptible
to sensi-
tive races. There is so much talk about the ideal of peace, but to
Western man this ideal cannot seriously be brought any closer
as long as they remain meat eaters to the present degree.
The northern races have lived for many thousands
of years
in a harsh northern climate, where they cannot maintain
them-
selves without substantially
nourishing
food. The northern race
requires a concentrated,
almost rich and fatty diet. Northerners
have become physically accustomed to such a diet to such a de-
gree that a complete change in diet would cause severe health
consequences.
Therefore
conduct
yourself
as follows:
Limit
your meat dishes to that which is absolutely
necessary.
Eat a
48
meal with meat no more than once or twice a week. Also, limit
the amount of sausage you eat, etc. Instead of meat, eat eggs,
cheese, milk, pasta, pancakes or farinaceous
food. Food that can
be recommended
is rice and corn, and also all kinds of nuts and
fruit. Fish in the ascetic sense is not meat. You can enjoy it
once a week. Coffee and tea are allowed, but only moderately
and
considerably
diluted
or watered
down.
In general,
the
amount of food you eat should be very moderate. Never eat to
the point that you feel satisfied. The satisfaction
of your palate
IS unnecessary.
(2)The
spiritual
frontal
attack
upon your weaknesses
is
waged as follows: Place a chair in front of you. Affix to it a pic-
ture of yourself, possibly one from earlier days. If your powers
of imagination
are already strong enough, then instead of using
the picture you can image yourself sitting on that chair.
Now stand in front of or opposite your picture and speak to
it as if it were a stranger, and address it in this manner: "Now I
know you! I despise your inclinations
towards (mention all the
bad characteristics
that you became aware of during the previ-
ous month). Between you and me I will build a partition
that
will separate us. I do not want to have anything to do with you
anymore. We are through with each other!"
Then turn the picture
on the chair around or away from
you, or turn your back to it and speak of your new intentions
or
resolutions
in short but conclusive
sentences.
You must take
great care when formulating
these sentences;
be certain
that
they are positive and not negative. For example, you should not
say: "I will not lie anymore,
I will not display any more bad
manners, I will not enter into any dubious business
dealings!"
Instead you should say: "Henceforth,
I will speak only the truth!
49
(or keep silent!),
I will develop only good habits, I will only
conduct business honestly," and so on. It is a law that a positive
abbreviated
sentence not only commits itself to one's memory
much more easily but is much more quickly and easily turned
into deeds than a negative word. Therefore act accordingly!
You must pronounce
these sentences
with great emphasis
in the following manner: Make two fists and extend your arms
forward at shoulder height. When you pronounce
the word "I,"
quickly pull in both arms, and then thrust them forward again
when you utter the word "will."
Repeat
this procedure
with
every single power sentence. You must always do this with the
greatest possible muscle tension, just as if you were doing some
heavy physical work, or as if you were lifting heavy weights or
something similar. You will understand
that when you perform
these thrusting motions you can give your life a proper new im-
pulse, a new stimulus of energy. In a manner of speaking, you
are starting the ball rolling.
The best
time for this exercise
is early
morning.
You
should begin the day with this exercise in order to be influenced
by it all day. It would be most advantageous
to practice
these,
sentences
immediately
after you awaken,
with your eyes still .
closed. As soon as you notice progress in one direction
or an-
other,
limit yourself
only to the most important
points.
The
more you progress, the sooner you can omit the first entire part
of this particular exercise, namely addressing the picture.
(3)The
three
muscle-control
exercises
should
be
done
daily, in sequence, i.e., the first exercise once, then the second
exercise once, then the third exercise once.
The first exercise is as follows: Seat yourself at a table,in
a tall and erect posture, without touching the table. Then stretch
50
your arms out and keep them straight and rigid; place them in
front of you on the table, with both hands side by side clenched
in a fist. Now begin very slowly to stretch out the thumb of your
right hand, controlling
every phase of this motion as if it were
of the greatest importance to you. Then follow the same proce-
dure with the index finger and continue with all the other fin-
gers of the right hand, until all the fingers on the right hand are
outstretched.
Once you have done so, reverse the entire proce-
dure, beginning with the little finger, until all fingers are in the
same position
as when you started, and the clenched
fist lies
before you as it did in the beginning. Then begin with your left
hand and follow the same procedure.
The second muscle-control
exercise
is as follows:
Fill a
wine glass to the rim with water. Hold it in your right hand and
raise the glass so that the water level of the glass is level with
your lips. Then stretch out your arm with the glass in hand to
the right side very slowly, without trembling or spilling a drop
of water. Observe
this entire procedure
very intensely.
Then
reverse the whole procedure
and return the glass to its point of
origin. Repeat the procedure with your left hand.
The
third
muscle-control
exercise
is as follows:
Stand
erect, heels together, and look straight ahead. This slow walking
motion is divided into three phases; count from 1 to 3 with each
motion. Beginning the first phase with the left foot, slowly lift
your heel on the count of 1 and, by the time you have counted to
3, bend your knee; everything is executed in very slow motion.
It should take a minimum of 5 seconds. (In the beginning,
time
these movements!)
By the time you have counted to the second
3, you will have lifted your left leg and moved your foot for-
ward, the same as if you were walking. This will be executed in
the same time-span as the first phase, and this phase should be
51
just as intensely
observed
as with all the previous
exercises.
During the third phase, by the time you have counted to 3 you
will be setting your left foot on the ground, shifting your body
weight onto the left foot, and, while you are counting 3, pulling
your right foot so that it is next to the left foot, in the same po-
sition
as when you started.
Again,
observe
every movement
very closely and intensely.
After this, begin the exercise
with
the right foot. Should you not succeed with one or the other ex-
ercise, then repeat it that same day.
(4)Usually
you do not have your mind completely
on your
work during many of your activities
in everyday life, but think
of all kinds of other things. In the morning, while taking your
bath and when you are getting dressed, you might think, for ex-
ample, of things you have to do that morning or a meeting you
have to attend that day. While you have lunch, you might think
of a certain letter you have to write, etc.
The minor concentration
exercise consists
of having your
thoughts exclusively on the object with which you are occupied
at the moment, or with the activity, which is just as necessary.
You should learn to consciously
pay attention to your thoughts,
to keep them together. Know that there really is no such thing
as an "inferior"
activity. It will become inferior if you execute it
badly. Direct your will towards taking care of everything
in the
best way possible. Be completely attentive; be deeply engrossed
in what you are doing at the moment. If you write a letter, if you
wash your hands, if you are reading a book, if you play with a
child or a dog, if you eat dinner or knot your tie -
in every-
thing you do, pay attention only to what you are doing.
Your thoughts will always try to drift, especially
in the be-
ginning.
Call them back to the point where they left off with
52
firm perseverance.
Do not get tired of immediately
correcting
yourself of the slightest deviation from what you want.
Choose
a different
hour for this exercise
every day. For
instance, begin this exercise on the first day from 8:00 A.M. to
9:00 A.M., the second day from 9:00 A.M. to 10:00 A.M., and
so forth.
Continue
in this manner
every day until you have
reached the evening hours and have covered all the hours of the
day, then begin again in the morning. This exercise is very im-
portant. Not only will it give you a better memory, which you
will
soon
notice,
but
it is also
the
preliminary
stage
and
preparatory
exercise for the major concentration
exercise which
is part of next month's
program. The more precisely,
conscien-
tiously and successfully you execute your exercise now, the eas-
ier it will be for you to succeed with those which follow . You
have to work hard for each level; nothing will come by itself.
(5)The avoidance of unnecessary
expenditure
of energy by
remaining absolutely calm is the counterpart or side-piece to the
minor concentration.
The energy which is employed during con-
centration
in a certain
direction
-
which, in other words, is
consumed
for a practical
purpose -
must be gained by over-
coming wishes (6) and by maintaining
your composure
(5). The
exercises numbered 4 to 6 are in an important inner relationship
to each other, which you must understand
and which you must
take into consideration.
Think about this relationship
so that
you yourself know the mechanism which you want to set in mo-
tion.
Be mindful of the fact that you have to maintain your com-
posure; in other words, you have to remain calm under all cir-
cumstances,
inwardly as well as outwardly!
During the course of the day you are assailed by many new
temptations,
which not only cause you to react in one way or
53
another
but whose intention
it is to also interfere
with yom
peace of mind. And it is this peace of mind alone in which you
can maintain your energy. People or things attempt to cause you
to be annoyed, angry, fearful, hateful, envious, passionate,
etc..
in order to draw the current
of energy of your volition
and
thinking
towards themselves
and to benefit from your energy.
They want to draw the energy from you because with every ex-
citement you are relinquishing
energy. A very excitable persor
is always weaker than a calm person. The stronger you are by
nature, the more diligently
you are flattered
and sought out by
people and things. Attempts are made to coax you into conver-
sations, to internal and external participation
in various events.
The object of their actions is, so they say, to help you "come
out of your shell!" In reality, however, it means nothing more
than that these people begrudge
you the condition
you are in
because you have gathered so much energy, which they suspect
or feel that you possess, and which they want to enjoy with you.
Therefore, the first commandment
that you have to obey is
Isolation!
Consider
yourself
to be
an electric
accumulator,
which has to carefully
control any output of its own current.
Never pursue other people -
on the whole, keep more to your-
self. That does not mean that you should live like a hermit You
must find a happy medium. Learn to be reserved
without
of-
fending
other people
and without
attracting
any attention. A
certain amount of isolation
is absolutely
desirable
if you want
to progress on your new path.
Pay close attention
as to whether each new acquaintance
that enters your sphere of activity or tries to make contact with
you actually wants something from you that takes energy away
from you. Govern yourself and your inner position accordingly
-
beware! Again, this does not mean that you should deal with
54
your friends
and acquaintances
in an unpleasant,
repulsive
or
unfriendly
manner. You should be a true humanitarian,
what-
ever the situation
may be. Learn to be helpful,
obliging
and
considerate
without exhausting yourself.
If you maintain your inner as well as your outer calm under
all circumstances,
you may be assured that you will preserve a
certain
amount
of energy in reserve.
Should you notice
that
something
threatens
to
pull
you
out
of
this
position
of
tranquility,
immediately prevent this danger by actively erecting
a wall of thoughts,
a spiritual
bulwark,
between
you and the
object of temptation.
You can accomplish
this in the following
manner:
Improvise
a
sitting-still
exercise
as
well
as
you
possibly can under the circumstances
(this can be done so that it
goes totally
unnoticed
by anyone else). Then image yourself
completely
surrounded
by an invisible
steel dome which does
not allow any serious disturbance
to come close to you. If you
are subject by nature to exasperation,
then you should practice
this thought-picture
often without having any special reason to
do so. You will find that it will prove its worth.
(6)The
accumulator
exercise
goes hand in hand with the
previous
exercise.
It is not a matter of suppressing
all wishes
that emerge
during
the course
of a day, because
that would
trigger
severe
and
unpleasant
reactions.
Remember,
your
organism
is
entitled
to
many
wishes,
which
imperatively
demand fulfillment
if the organism is to continue to exist. It is
your little brother,
which you have to take care of. But you
cannot allow him to subjugate you. Always remember that this
is his nature. Therefore,
in order to accumulate
the energy of
your wishes, practice the non-fulfillment
of your wishes.

(a)Negative
Exercise
Examples:
Deny
yourself
little
conveniences
when you sit down -
remove the cushion you are
used
to. Do
not
choose
a comfortable
chair,
but
pick
an
especially
hard or uncomfortable
chair.
Do not wear house
shoes. Deny yourself
certain things while eating,
such as the
sugar, the salt or other spices that you enjoy. Do not use any
butter
on your sandwich.
Take the smaller
portion
of your
favorite
foods. Eat the least of those foods that you like the
most. Drink
only water for an entire
day. Do not eat your
favorite meat on your sandwich for a whole day. Also, omit a
meal which is not important,
such as afternoon
tea or coffee.
Deny yourself
the conveniences
of your professional
life to
which you have become accustomed.
Deny yourself
a visit to
the theater, to a concert, or something you were looking forwarc
to. Do not buy something that you intended to buy simply for
pleasure. (It could be a book, a rare stamp, a vase, a newspaper
etc.)
Deny
yourself
conveniences
as
to
your
sleeping
accommodations
by removing
the
bedside
rug;
replace
the
pillow
with a head-roll
or place
a large note-book
or board
under your pillow.
(b) Positive Exercise Examples:
Do things which you have
to force yourself to do or things which, up to now, you did not
like to do. You may have to write an unpleasant
letter which
you should have written
long ago, and you "never found the
time" to write. Write this letter now.
You wanted
a heart-to-heart
talk with someone,
but for
many reasons you always postponed it. Do it now!
Should you have some urgent shopping to do, instead  of
doing this in a hurry and taking
the shortest
route,
make a
detour and force yourself to walk very slowly. Or, for instance,
56
if it irritates
you when you hear certain
sounds,
like a slate
pencil on
slate,
or
chalk
on
a blackboard,
the
filing
of
fingernails with an emery board, or when someone passes his
hand over velvet and so on -
force yourself to listen to them
with a sunny disposition
and the greatest inner peace, and make
it happen!
Should you have an aversion towards certain animals, for
instance cats, frogs, spiders or snakes, get close to these ani-
mals as soon as you have the opportunity,
touch them, pet them,
and be a good friend to them. Be mindful of the fact that the
World Spirit created them as well as it did you, and in sub-
stance you are definitely related to them. You should hate noth-
ing, since everything
originates
from the One Spirit, and you
must
make every effort
to overcome
aversion
or dislike,
as
when certain human beings, animals or things make you shud-
der.
Also overcome the disgust for certain foods which you do
not like.
All these negative
and positive
exercises
should be prac-
ticed
without
the feeling
of coercion.
You should
do them
gladly, with joy and with an inner vivacity of the soul. As long
as you do not achieve this, as long as you moan and groan, you
have not grasped the essence of this exercise. The external atti-
tude is important, but even more important is the inner attitude.
You should endeavor to attain the feeling of being penetrated
with that joyful equanimity which is superior to all things. Your
mood, your contentment,
should no longer
be dependent
on
something
external.
Be a rock of calm and contentment,
un-
touched
by notions
such as "little"
and "much,"
"good"
and
"bad," "comfortable"
and "uncomfortable."
Practice the feeling
of being a rock until it has become second nature.
57
Certainly, the above examples are only a point of reference
as to how these exercises
should
be executed.
You are not
bound by them without exception -
you can add some of your
own. This, however,
applies only to the positive
and negative
exercises
above; .all the other exercises
have to be strictly ad-
hered to. Exercise
every day, with a minimum of one positive
and one negative exercise.
Your daily schedule is as follows:
In the morning:
Spiritual frontal attack and muscle-control
exercises.
During the course of the day:
One hour minor concentration;
maintain your composure  or
peace of mind; accumulator exercise.
In the evening:
Daily criticism and making plans for the coming day.
THIRD
LETTER
RISE
UP
AND
BECOME
LIGHT
Introduction
By now you should have a clear picture
of the nature of the
power of thought,
your strongest
weapon of life and death in
this existence.
You know how this power is nourished,
how to
gather
and
store
it and protect
it from
loss.
If you
have
completed
the First and Second Letters,
you have learned
to
58
utilize
this power
for yourself
through
the easy method
of
concentration.
Before commencing
with the higher methods of concentra-
ion, you must become acquainted
with the manner in which
you can pursue the effects of this course of instruction
to the
furthest
extent and how you can control the progress you have
already made.
Before you enter upon this inward path, it is necessary
to
protect
yourself
from harmful
influences
that come from the
outside, because they can interfere or lead you astray from your
course
of development.
Therefore,
put your house
in order!
Withdraw
from all people you have recognized
as bad. Should
this be difficult
to do because of external circumstances,
limit
the association
to the barest
minimum
and under no circum-
stances become or remain intimate. Also erect in this instance
the invisible "steel dome." Only then will you be prepared.
The Inward Path
A human being is like a branch on a tree. You do not find the
greatest abundance
of sap in the bark, but on the inside of the
tree. Here the sap circulates
most actively
and connects
the
branch with the main trunk of the tree. That is where you must
search if you desire an insight into the secret activities
of the
powers that organize, build and destroy, and which so ardently
desire to control.
Just as the greening
leaves
correspond
to the day con-
sciousness,
the sap of the branches corresponds
to the subcon-
sciousness.
The functions
by which these subconscious
proce-
dures become conscious to you are dreams.
59
Dreams: The First Threshold
To The Beyond
If you wish to find the origin of all things, first you must folIow
the guidepost
of dreams. This is the entrance to the depths of
your existence.
This is the barometer
for the procedures
that
take place in your fluid body. This is where the primary pictures
which are to form within you are active. This is also where new
and super-sensitive
capabilities
first
show and reflect
them-
selves. It means you have to understand
the dream, if you Want
to observe the transformation
of your own depth.
Dreams:
A Second Reality
Know that dreams are just as much a real (or unreal) experience
as any waking experience.
The difference
lies merely
within
your state of consciousness.
In your daytime thinking
you are
externally distracted through the senses (compared to the leaes(
on a tree), whereas
your night-time
experiences
are inwardly
concentrated
(compared
to the circulation
of the sap in the
branch of a tree). While in this state your "I" is transferred to
another sphere of experience,
into another medium, and mostly
into the inner fluid body. You see what you perceive there, so to
speak, through another lens.
What you experience
there appears before you with a far
greater intensity than the occurrences
of the day. When you cry
in your dreams, your tears are hotter and more bitter than all the
tears you shed during
the day. You experience
insignificant
things, yet you perceive them with an extraordinary
profundity.
And it is always you who experiences
these events and no one
else. And when you awake relieved or sad in the morning, you
60
should not say "It was only a dream!" and then try to forget eve-
rything as quickly as possible. Instead you should ask yourself,
"What was this dream trying to tell me?" Dreams are just like
the events of the day; they are messengers
with sealed letters,
written in a coded secret writing. What they have to tell you can
be important and of unique value.
All Dreams
Are Allegorical
The secret writing of dreams is written in symbols which you
have to learn to decode. These symbols, in their entirety, form a
language which is far above all languages in the world, the uni-
versal language of the spirit, and is understandable
to everyone
once he has found the key.
The decipherment
of dreams
is nowadays
again
on the
verge of becoming
a meaningful
science. The concept
of this
book does not require more than a brief outline. It should, how-
ever, suffice to give you a good start. Even in this instance,
what will advance you the most will be your own work. Whoso-
ever wants to penetrate the secrets of dreams does not require a
keen intellect, but must possess imagination
and some intuition
for his own peculiar picture language. Then you will discover
what the psychic disequilibrium
wants to convey to you, and its
finest barometer is the dream.
You have to clearly understand
that every dream must be
understood
symbolically
either in its entirety or at least in part.
For instance, a businessman
with no children dreams that he is
throwing a small child into the water. Interpretation:
He is giv-
ing up a new plan, which he rather would have liked to imple-
ment. A military officer dreams that he is placed into a coffin in
full
uniform.
Interpretation:
He changes
his profession
and
61
"dies" as an officer. Although every person has his own dream
type which is significant to him alone -
and much more so the
more developed his spiritual life is -
it is also a fact of experi-
ence that certain dream symbols reoccur and have a particular
meaning to most human beings; to know them is very useful.
Body Symbolism
For instance:
The limbs or parts of the body mostly represent
members of the family or valuable possessions;
the loss of teeth
usually represents
the demise of a relative.
On the other hand,
new teeth can mean new possessions
and the like. It is also in-
teresting to know that certain body orifices or openings and in-
dividuallimbs
take the place of others. For instance, the thumb
takes the place of the male genitals, the nostril takes the place
of the ear, etc. This also applies to the body liquids. Milk, for
instance, can represent blood. An increase in the weight of the
whole body or parts of the body, as for instance the face, sym-
bolizes prosperity in material and health matters. Loss of weight
represents
the opposite.
Doubling
the size of the body repre-
sents marriage. Dissolution
or transformation
of the body points
to death. The body is often represented
as a machine or an appa-
ratus, even more so as a house, and the individual rooms corre-
spond to the body cavities. The head and the forehead represent
the top floor or the attic. Spiders in the attic mean headaches;
the eye is a window, the stomach is the kitchen, the intestine a
dark
passage,
hallway
or subway,
the abdominal
cavity
the
basement. An important personality
entering the basement with
a light could mean that a doctor examines the abdominal cavity.
Blood shows itself as light, the activity of the heart as a rhyth-
mical flashing and darkening light. Also, red colors such as red
62
roses, red wallpaper,
and red clothing
are often a symbol of
blood. Tears show themselves as pearls.
Money Symbols
In accordance
with the part money plays in everyday life, there
are an infinite number of symbols for money, even in a dream.
Among these -
in accordance with their form -
there are also
opposite symbols. Everything that has to do with gold and silver
or any semblance thereof -
golden hair, valuables etc. -
is to
be understood
as a symbol of money. Cutting one's hair means
loss of money.
Money
is also symbolized
by vermin
of all
kinds, such as lice, fleas, bedbugs. Furthermore,
the analogy of
excrement,
whether human or animal in origin, lies in the fact
that it is also a product of one's labor, namely the labor of the
body.
Often, blood is also a money symbol; there is a saying that
you have to "bleed," meaning you have to pay. Everything
that
is eaten, such as meat, bread, cake, game (venison), cattle, etc.,
means income, especially as far as men are concerned.
Further-
more, symbols of fertility such as eggs, fruit, rice and fish rep-
resent income as far as women are concerned.
Fertility
And Love
Now we have reached the voluminous subject of sexual symbol-
ism, which is of great importance.
In regards
to women, the
principal
female organ, the womb, appears often as a physical
mother. Should she appear as being "inebriated,"
it means the
dreamer is pregnant. Sweets and the picking of flowers are en-
dearments
and enjoyments
of love. Children are represented
as
63
jewels,
mirror
images,
photographs.
Male genitals
appear
in
many different disguises such as a lance, an arrow, a rifle, or a
revolver,
whereas when women dream of their fathers it oddly
enough represents the male genitals. The male semen appears as
flour or wine. Should the real, physical father appear, he will
usually appear in the form of some imposing personality
such as
an emperor, general, principal of a company and the like.
Animal
Symbolism
Animals
mean different
things,
often
feelings
and passions.
Dogs, for instance, represent low sensuous desires; cats, treach-
erous adverse thoughts;
large predators,
such as lions, croco-
diles
etc., represent
danger;
horses,
fiery
sensuality;
worms,
maggots, and snakes, sickness and any kind of unpleasantness;
legendary animals, adversarial thoughts.
Death And Life
Vital energy expresses itself as a fire in the stove and a supply
of coal, also in greening and evergreen trees and plants, as well
as in light, radiating
flames. Illnesses
show themselves
in the
form of a consuming
fire with or without smoke, at times also
as invasive and rising water; black animals such as dogs, mice,
cats and ravens represent death and sickness.
At times death shows itself as a person, skeleton, ferryman,
clergy, stranger etc. The colors of death are black, white, gray,
blue, violet
and purple.
Approaching
sickness
and death ex-
presses itself in the form of an engagement, and death itself as a
wedding.
64
Weather Symbolism
Clouds,
especially
thunderstorms,
always
represent
dangers.
Flaming inscriptions
are always warnings,
and they are espe-
cally meaningful
when they appear in the sky. Sunny weather
and a pleasant,
smiling
landscape
always
symbolizes
a good
state of affairs in a particular
matter. The darker the weather in
a certain
scene, the bleaker
its sense. More serious
dangers
sow themselves
in the picture of a runaway car or horse and
wagon, or a speeding
train. Great catastrophes
or revolutions
anounce themselves
to the dreamer through
cosmic
symbols
such as flooding, earthquakes,
falling or occultation
of the sun
or moon, comets, fiery shapes in the sky.
Dreams
Of Motion
The extraordinarily
frequent dream of driving in a car or travel-
ing on a train or boat is the journey of life upon which we have
all embarked. If you dream about a smooth and fast journey
in
one of the above vehicles, the smoother you will find your jour-
ney of life. The more obstacles there are in your path, the more
laborious will be your existence or the problems with which you
are occupied
at the moment. Dreams of flying are dreams of
ambition,
where a person
deems himself
to be above others.
Rhythmical
forward movement such as riding, swimming, bicy-
cling, dancing, etc., usually represents eroticism.
65
The Purpose And Goal
Of Dreaming
The dream takes these thousands
of pictures from the treasury
of your memory and arranges them for its purpose. Accordingly,
a symbol can have very different meanings. The value of these
symbols
is never absolute.
What you experience
are the in-
tended actions, where you yourself are both audience and actor.
We are dealing here with a dual personality,
where all the peo-
ple that appear and act in your dreams flow together
into one
whole person at the moment you awaken. The entire kaleido-
scope that you experience
is you yourself. The purpose of this
whole experience is to equilibrate
all the severe tensions which
exist in you. Most of your dreams are in one sense or another
wish dreams or dreams of fear or anxiety. The more undevel-
oped your soul is, the more dreams of that nature you will have.
Remember this well.
Dream Control
As A Barometer
Of The Soul
Constant dream control continuously
gives you an insight into
the events of your own inner self. You recognize which kinds of
wishes and fears are active within you. You learn to know with-
out any further
ado, that is, without
aesthetic
and moral ex-
tenuation or disguise, where you have not overcome your short-
comings. You must learn how to examine your dreams in a self-
critical
manner, in other words, you have to have it out with
your dreams.
The deeper you penetrate, the clearer it will become to you
that many dreams have a secret double meaning, and this will
66
become apparent to you when you have reached a certain level
of maturity
in your development.
Love and death, father and
mother,
and
other
symbols
bear
an
even
higher
mystical
meaning, which you must find. If the soul herself appears as a
symbol,
you experience
her as a bird; also, if you dream of
flying, it will unveil to you many a secret in this connection.
The further you progress,
the more will the character
of
your dreams change. Much of what was in the foreground
will
fade. New signs and types of scenes will emerge -
but you will
learn from all of them. Gradually, in accordance with your inner
development
and ability of concentration,
dreams of the higher
type will mix with the games of the lower sphere of conscious-
ness.
And you will receive proof of the practical
awakening
of
higher
energies
within you. You begin to become
conscious
through Christianization
and enlightenment
of the soul from the
higher trinity. The lower quadruplicity,
inclusive
of the body,
becomes
refined
and receptive
for these highly
spiritual
im-
pulses and enters into the service of the superior systems.
Hand in hand with this dream work goes the further school-
ing of the powers of thought, of which you will find more de-
tailed information
in the explanations.
Above all: Major Con-
centration.
Major Concentration
Major concentration
is also called the "collection"
or "immer-
sion" and is divided into a passive and an active phase. The
passive phase precedes
the active phase, and it strives to ac-
complish, as far as is possible, a complete immobilization
of the
entire lower quadruplicity
as much as is feasible to avoid any
67
unnecessary
energy consumption
in this respect.
The scholar
who is completely
taken up by his work and the businessman
who becomes totally absorbed with making money are already
unconsciously
practicing this concentration
exercise at a certain
level. When the scholar writes a first-class work that makes him
famous and the businessmen
becomes a financial tycoon which
influences
the fate of whole nations, they are indebted
to this
type of concentration.
You shall now learn how to systematically
develop and di-
rect all your attention to one point. It is achieved in the follow-
mg manner:
A.
Passive
Phase:
Switch
off
all
external
attractions.
Choose a dark room. Make certain that there is complete silence
all around you and that you remain alone. Assume a position of
rest which is appropriate
for you. First, try the following:
Take
a seat on a comfortable chair, if possible an easy chair. Sit in an
unconstrained
position;
rest your head and back against
the
back of the chair with your hands on your knees. Place your feet
side by side, 4 - 6 inches (10 - 15 cm) apart. Close your eyes.
Make an effort to bring every muscle of your body into a
complete
state of relaxation.
Do this very systematically.
Turn
your inner attention first to your left arm; think persistently
that.
your left arm should relax to the fullest extent. It is a law that
I
this relaxation
will succeed to a greater degree the more pre-
cisely you think about it. Think first that the upper arm should
relax; imagine this to the finest detail. Imagine how one muscle
fiber after the other gives up its tension. Think: "I withdraw my
energy entirely!"
68
Then continue in the same manner with the elbow, forearm,
wrist, the hand and fingers. Then do the same with your right
arm and continue with the rest of the body.
The first goal of the relaxation
exercise
has been accom-
plished when you no longer
feel your body or any of your
limbs. During this entire inner process your breathing
should
continuein a calm and even manner.
The second goal is to bring all your thoughts to rest. This is
the more difficult part of your task and sounds easier than it is.
Just when you have reached
this point of rest, your thoughts
begin to protest, and they behave like a family of climbing apes
or like a swarm of disturbed
bees and are indignant
about the
coercive force that wants to rule them. Another difficulty exists
with some people because of their inclination
to fall asleep. Be
alert and remember
that you should not fall asleep under any
circumstances.
Instead
you should remain
completely
awake;
you should become accustomed
to a special state of wakeful-
ness, because it is the fundamental basis for everything that fol-
lows.
It would serve the purpose if you would be guided during
this entire process by envisaging
an upright burning flame that
is as straight
as an arrow. What you should
retain
in your
thoughts is: "I am wide awake and I resemble a quietly burning
flame! "
The state of absolute inner steadfastness
which is produced
through this procedure
is of a very particular
kind and it will
probably
take a few attempts before you succeed. What is re-
ferred
to as "attempts"
applies only to the external
position.
Should you not succeed in the position
indicated,
then repeat
the exercise in a different
position,
for instance lying on your
back, on your side, kneeling,
or in a squat position.
You can
69
also put your hands into a different
position -
you can fold
them, make a loose fist, or place them in your lap in such a
manner
that the outside
surface
of the fingers
of one hand
touches
the outside
surface of the fingers
of the other hand.
Remain with the position
which gives you the best results.
It
might take several days to find the right position. Only a practi-
cal approach to this problem will yield the best results and will
further your progress.
The goal, as mentioned
before,
is internal
and external
steadfastness.
Once
you have
accomplished
that,
the active
phase follows.
B. Active Phase: This phase can be structured
in various
ways in accordance with your intentions. It can consist of:
1. A self-command,
or
2. Meditation,
or
3. Contemplation.
(1)
Autosuggestion
and
Belief:
Autosuggestion
(self-
command) is by far the most effective manner in which you can
influence your habits, deep into the organic area. It is the spiri-
tual flank attack which will certainly lead you to victory, even
when dealing with deep-rooted
shortcomings
and even when the
frontal attack is not sufficient.
You must proceed with a plan which you have determined
beforehand;
that is, you have to employ suggestion formulas, as
mentioned
previously,
which are positive,
powerful
and brief.
("Under
all circumstances
I remain courageous!"
or "Day by
day I have myself under better control!" or "My health is incon-
testable! ")
70
When dealing
with a particular
narrowly
defined
object,
you would be well advised to draw in your mind a clear outline
or picture of the goal you wish to attain. For instance, see your-
self endowed
with the attribute
you are trying to attain.
The
livelier the colors and forms of this imaginary picture, the more
exactly will it be executed by the powers of formation
of your
organism and turned into practice.
Your fluid, spiritual
body
obeys this order and, with the certainty of a mathematical
law,
puts the necessary powers into motion to reach the goal, regard-
less of whether
this body has received
only general
or well-
dedined
instructions.
This body accepts the order without ques-
tion and it becomes its dogma; it will obey blindly. Every belief
has come into being in this or a similar manner.
The act of implanting
or memorizing
can be accomplished
in various ways. The simplest approach is to convince yourself
of the order or the autosuggestion
by quiet recitation
in your
mind. This has to be done as follows:
word by word, slowly,
with a pause after each word. The sentence has to be repeated
several times in short intervals.
Besides this simple and, so to
speak, basic method, there are others with which you will be-
come acquainted during the course of this schooling.
(2) The Nature Of Meditation:
When you practice medi-
tation you are dealing with the inner immersion
of a sequence
of pictures with corresponding
feelings. Pictures,
like feelings,
are exactly specified or outlined. The closer observation
begins
by embellishing
the original picture in detail. This has to occur
with absolute
exclusivity,
and will represent
no difficulties
if
the first passive concentration
phase is practiced properly. Once
this is understood,
then follow the development
of the sequence
of pictures before your spiritual eyes which goes hand in hand
71
with the corresponding
immersion.
This immersion
must take
place with such inner conviction
that the observer and the ob-
ject of his observation become, so to speak, one. Once you have
mastered that, the result is the third phase, the phase of enlight-
enment or inspiration,
a comprehension
and understanding
of
the most profound
truthfulness
of the entire sequence
of pic-
tures. You will only be able to understand
that
in its entire
depth with which you are able to consciously
merge internally.
This procedure is a process entirely of its own and of a particu-
lar manner, which on the whole cannot be properly explained;
rather, it must be experienced.
(3) The Nature Of Contemplation:
The nature of contem-
plation, as indicated by its name, means to remain in the same
motionless
position with a single concept in the form of a pic-
ture. The spirit is completely
motionless
and directed
towards
one particular
object. Then the spirit will experience
the merg-
ing process,
mentioned
before, of the consciousness
with the
proper exercise and aptitude. The higher level of this condition
presents itself as ecstasy and is not readily granted to everyone.
It would be desirable to reach this level, especially
if intensive
consequences
upon your everyday life are to be achieved. More
will be said about this subject in another chapter.
Before we begin with the practice
of the third level, we
should note that exercises 5 to 7 in the previous Letter (the ex-
ercise
of remaining
calm, the accumulator
exercise,
and the
daily
self-criticism)
have to be maintained
permanently.
We
must not pass through the course in such a way that we com-
plete level after level of subject matter that we consider
to be
painful
but which we forget later on. We want to achieve
a
transformation
and development
of the entire personality;
we
72
want to form attributes
of permanence
of the highest
value
which remain an asset to us that we shall never lose.
Practical
Exercises
Of
The Third Level
1. Record your dreams every morning and seek to obtain a
clear understanding
of their significance.
2. Practice five minutes of power breathing every morning.
3. Practice
a preliminary
concentration
exercise
daily, al-
ternating between these two exercises:
(a) the object exercise described in 3(a) below, or
(b) the fantasy exercise.
4. Practice point fixation daily.
5. Alternate a daily meditation on the following:
(a) death and burial, or
(b) the tree of life
6. Practice the spiritual flank attack.
Explanations
(1) The best method of recording your dreams is in a diary,
which you have to change or arrange accordingly.
The purpose
would be best served if you record your dreams on the left hand
page of your diary and the events of the day on the right; or you
can arrange
a single page in that manner.
The purpose
is to
bring daily events into some relationship
with your dreams. (In
this regard more explanations
will follow in this chapter.)
Your
dream
experiences
take
place
in the
fluid
body,
without
any
mediation
of the
sensory
organs.
The
dream
approaches
your
"I"
from
another,
unaccustomed
side.
73
Therefore,
as a consequence,
you are inclined
to forget
the
events in your dreams immediately
unless they are impressed
upon your physical memory at once. It is absolutely
necessary
that
everything
you
dream
be
recorded
immediately
upon
awakening. At the very least, write down the key words so that
you can fill in the gaps later on. If you choose the key words
properly, it will be sufficient to recall the entire event.
Remember,
every dream you process is mostly a dream of
desire or fear. Through these dreams you can look into the most
secret chambers of your hopes and worries. The prime elements
of a dream,
its pictures,
are merely
aids through
which the
dream attempts to express a thought,
and nothing
more. Even
where long forgotten pictures that seldom appear have emerged
again, they do not appear or emerge for their own sake but al-
ways as the means to an end. And to find this purpose is your
task. If a dead person appears to you in a dream, that person
may not actually be signified; rather, the dream may only want
to say to you: "Something old and long forgotten is returning!"
A large gathering at which you are present only signifies in the
end that you will be in contact with many people. Never forget
that these are pictures,
pictures,
pictures.
At times a dream is
words in pictures, or an illustration
of the words of a sentence,
a proverb, an expression,
an idiom. For instance: "Having your
eye on someone,"
"to butter someone up," or "to trick some-
one."
How these things will be represented
in a dream is impos-
sible to calculate because of the abundance of analogies. All the
above examples
do not have an absolute,
but only a relative,
value which changes accordingly.
In the beginning, in your search for the right interpretation,
you will in all probability
fail many times. Do not let this affect
74
you. Should a dream remain incomprehensible
to you for the
time being, examine
it again tomorrow
or the following
day.
The more your inner development progresses,
the more you will
discover distinct relationships
with your everyday life.
Do not believe
that you work in vain to overcome
your
fears and desires; try especially
to overcome all passions.
This
is not a senseless
sport. Rather, it serves a more serious pur-
pose: to calm down the ripples on the mirror of your soul in or-
der to give her the possibility
of reflecting clear pictures of the
spiritual
world,
comprehending
the truthfulness
of things
as
faithfully as possible, and communicating
them to you. Into the
dreams of passion or emotion, dreams of truth of various kinds
will eventually
become mixed. First, your dreams will be re-
ports to you of changes within your physical body, then reports
from the outside world, whether close or far away, and finally
there will be dreams that picture the future and that will give
you actual proof of a plane of occurrences
and experiences
in
which everything that occurs is indicated as the present.
In order to ascertain the content of a dream in this particu-
lar direction,
begin your interpretation
with this consideration:
Are you dealing here with a wish, an expectation
or fear? To
what extent could it be more than that? Record what you be-
lieve you have found. It is also advisable
to re-read
all your
dreams from time to time; often they will show a different
as-
pect, one which you did not see before. Pay special attention to
recurring dreams, as they are somehow of particular importance
to you.
(2) Power Breathing:
Early in the morning, stand in front
of your window.
Place your feet in an acute angle and look
straight ahead. Thrust your clenched fists parallel to each other
75
straight forward (starting position). Now execute power breath-
ing in three stages:
(a) Slow
inhalation.
At the
same
time
move
your
out-
stretched
arms to the side, fists clenched,
until they are in a
horizontal position in relationship
to your body.
(b) This is followed by slow exhalation.
At the same time,
move your arms downward on both sides until they are perpen-
dicular to the ground.
(c) Take a breather. At the same time, move your arms for-
ward into the stretched starting position.
All movements must be executed in slow motion, and each
of the above (a, b and c) breathing
exercises
should take 10
seconds. In the beginning,
use a watch. During the entire exer-
cise, the arms have to remain stretched and the fists clenched.
3(a)The
Object
Exercise:
Take a small object
into your
hands, such as a tin soldier, doll, photograph,
a small picture of
a landscape
(a postcard),
etc. Look at the object from all sides
as meticulously
as possible.
Do not think of anything but you
and the object. Pay attention to every detail and imprint it all
upon your mind, even the least important thing. Then close your
eyes and seek to recall that object so clearly, in all its finest de-
tails, that you have it, so to speak, tangibly
in front of you.
Make the effort until this condition occurs. As soon as this hap-
pens, open your eyes and compare the picture in your imagina-
tion with the real one. Correct any deviations.
Repeat this experiment with the same object, then repeat
it in the course of the day with other objects of your choice, but
do not use objects that are too large.
76
(b)The Fantasy Exercise:
Using a pencil, write down the
names of 9 objects that come into your mind at random. Close
your eyes and try to imagine one object after the other as clearly
as you can. This exercise
can only be considered
successful
when you see each object before your inner eye with such clar-
ity that you can touch it. Repeat this exercise during the course
of the day with other objects of your choice.
(4) Point Fixation:
The point fixation
exercise
is to be
practiced in the following manner. Draw a circle with a diame-
ter of approximately
1 inch (2 cm) on a white piece of paper. In
the center of this circle, draw a dot approximately
one-fifth of
an inch in size. Sit calmly in front of it in a comfortable
chair at
a distance of 5 feet (150 cm) and look at that dot. Fix your eyes
upon that dot for 1 minute without blinking and without moving
any muscle in the slightest. After the first minute has elapsed,
change your position by slowly bending your body forward, by
moving closer to the dot, and then by moving backwards
into
your original position.
Carry this movement
out several times
during the second minute.
Increase the duration of this exercise by a full minute every
second day, to a maximum of 12 minutes.
Should your eyes tear or burn, raise your eyebrows briefly
and this disturbance
will be eliminated.
If necessary,
you can
also wash your eyes with cold water or a cool chamomile
infu-
sion.
5(a)Meditation
-
Death and Burial:
The meditation
re-
garding death and burial should be carried out in complete ex-
ternal and internal tranquility;
therefore the best time will be in
the evening.
77
As soon as you are finished with th~ preliminary
passive
phase (part of the major concentration
in this chapter), picture
the following
as best as you can, as if you were present
and
observing everything that occurs: A human being has died. His
or her last breath has just escaped, and the eyes have lost their
sparkle. The limbs become rigid, the skin like wax. Green and
blue spots (livor mortis) appear on the back and wherever
the
body touches
a surface.
Out of the mouth runs
a brownish
decomposition
liquid. The entire body begins to give off an
odor. And you did so much for this body!
You fed this body as if there was nothing more valuable in
this world. Many times you became subservient
to this body;
when it expressed
carnal desires, you satisfied
its senses. And
what is your reward? Only what you see before you!
Then the corpse is adorned. The worthless shell of the soul
is dressed in festive garments, and surrounded with flowers, and
probably the corpse is kissed. It is placed into a coffin, the lid
closed
and tightened
down
with
bolts.
The
coffin
is then
lowered into the grave, covered with earth, and left to its fate.
The limbs of the corpse become soft like a sponge. Feel that!
The mouth is open and out of it drains a carrion-like
slimy
liquid,
which raises
a stench
in the coffin.
Smell this! The
wreaths in the grave have long ago become putrefied
and smell
of decay.
Soon the entire
corpse
swarms
with maggots
and
worms.
Observe this picture. Hear how these vermin wind through
the muscles and slowly pull them asunder, and how the worms
creep
through
the
sockets
of the
eyes,
through
the
lungs.
Maggots
wriggle
in the intestines.
Millions
upon millions
of
bacteria consume the soft abdominal parts as a desirable booty.
The corpse collapses;
there are open tears. Look at it! Whole
78
tendons
are exposed
everywhere,
and even these will also be
destroyed
and gnawed away. The entire body is a picture
of
mIsery.
And you have often betrayed your better part for this pic-
ture of misery, and you were to this body more obliging than it
deserved -
you pampered
it as if it were your most precious
possession.
And what is your reward? What you see before you!
Now look at it in all its magnificence -
all that is left is
the skull and the bare skeleton. The departed was probably vain
and proud of his beauty. Where is it now? He was probably
proud of his or her fine soft skin, the strength of his or her mus-
cles, and his or her beautiful facial features. Naked, the skull is
leering at you, vacant are the sockets of the eyes, the teeth are
without lips, the jaws hang loose. It will only take a short time
and the skeleton will be dust and ash. You will be able to blow
the dust with one breath into all directions.
And yet at one time
it was a human being! What an .insane exaggeration
for those
who saw their purpose of life in this decay!
Turn away, turn away, from
this chimera!
Even your life
can come to an end at any moment. All that has to happen is for
a small cerebral artery to burst, a vital center in the spinal cord
to fail,
or the heart to stand still -
and you step upon the
bridge to the world beyond. The seconds fly by and every sec-
ond brings you closer to this goal. Irrevocably,
the hand of the
clock races around the dial. Each minute comes and goes, never
to return again. Your whole life is a single fall towards death.
And you fill this short phase which is given to you with non-
sense.
Turn away, turn away from everything
transitory
and lead
your soul into the radiant kingdom
of exalted thoughts.
Turn
away from everything
mortal and rise up towards immortality.
79
Turn away! Oh, turn away from the form because it breaks -
may it be ever so enticing
-
and recognize
the Spirit
which
is
above
and behind
all forms,
Who outlasts
and rises
above
all,
because
He created
them all. Turn away,
and you shall be saved
from
destruction.
(b)Meditation
-
The Tree Of Life: Practice the meditation
on the Tree of Life in the same fashion as the previous exercise.
Immerse
yourself
in the manner described
into the following
picture: A mighty tree stands evergreen above an eternal spring.
Look how broad and mighty its branches
spread to all sides.
How fresh and full of life the green beckons you. Is it an oak? Is
it an ash? It looms mightier than the universe; you cannot see its
top. A power current nourishes the entire tree from the roots to
the top and disburses into the last and finest of branches. Come
closer and inspect the single leaves; each is different
from the
other, each leaf has its own peculiarities.
Picture this individu-
ally.
Once in a while a branch withers away. Then a human be-.
ing might say: A certain species of animal has become extinct, a
nation perishes. Once in a while the tree sprouts new branches.
Then a human being would say: A new plant, a new nation
comes
into existence!
Regularly,
withered
leaves
fall to the
ground -
those are corpses
that dissolve
into the elements.
Every dead person is represented
by such a leaf, as such a with-
ered leaf never attains eternal life. However, where is the leaf's
path to immortality?
. . .
There are two paths: one to the outside and the other to the
inside. The sap which nourished the leaf must travel to the blos-
som, whose urge is outward. It is pollinated and develops into a
fruit. A new tree unfolds next to the old one, and in a very short
80
time the same cycle repeats itself endlessly.
This is the path
away from the primary source, the path of external fecundation,
the outward path. The other path is when the sap that nourished
the leaf withdraws
into the branch, into the trunk of the tree,
and unites with the original sap current which was there from
the beginning,
which to him is father and mother at the same
time. That is the shortest path to immortality,
the path to God's
heart, the path of internal
fecundation,
the path to the Inner-
most.
There are the two paths. Which one has been yours so far?
Which path will be yours in the future? You too are a leaf on
the tree of the world. And you too have a choice concerning
how you want to travel. Have you traveled the external path be-
cause of thoughtlessness?
Or did you do it because of a sense of
duty to your nation,
your family?
Have you never
felt that
shudder of passing away which pervades one who exhausts
all
his power or strength on the external path? Did your ears never
hear the warning:
"Swing
the wheel
round
or change
your
course!"
Continuance
from generation
to generation
does not spare
you the death of your consciousness.
The race continues to live;
only the individual dies. However, if you yourself want to enter
into the eternal life, you have to change and choose the path to
the great Innermost,
the path into the unspeakable
sanctuary.
You have to prepare
your consciousness
now for the coming
unification.
You have to withdraw your sap current at the right
time,
with
your
entire
will.
Only
in this
manner
will
you
become the right vessel. Only in this manner will you obtain the
exquisite
possession.
Only in this manner
will the Crown of
Life become yours, that for which the best of humankind
have
striven
since time immemorial.
Adhere
to this thought
with
81
exclusive
devotion;
examine
these
thoughts
from
all sides.
Become completely absorbed in this. Seek to awaken within you
the feeling of a holy yearning. And again and again reach for
the picture of the tree.
Alternate
every evening with the previous
meditation,
so
that you meditate one evening on Death and Burial and the fol-
lowing evening on the Tree of Life. Practice as a rule for half
an hour, and do not extend it any longer, but also do not prac-
tice for less. Should you have passed over this train of thought
too quickly, repeat it once more. Control the length of time with
a watch.
(6) The Spiritual
Flank Attack: The best time to accom-
plish the flank attack is while falling asleep. Once you have
bedded down comfortably,
practice
the relaxation
exercise
al-
ready described
(A. Passive Phase). This exercise will be very
easy when it is done while in bed. At the right moment, give
yourself the autosuggestions
which you have prepared.
Here it
is very important to seize the moment between being awake and
falling asleep. You should take the autosuggestion
with you into
your sleep. In this manner even the night must serve your as-
cent. The more often you practice this, the better you will suc-
ceed. I suggest that every week you change your autosuggestion
in accordance with content and form.
Your daily schedule is therefore as follows:
Early morning:
Record your dreams, probably
first in key words. Power
breathing.
82
During the course of the day:
Concentration
and preliminary exercises. Point fixation.
Evening:
Meditation,
daily
criticism
and
making
plans,
spiritual
flank attack.
FOURTH
JLETTER
RISE UP AND BECOME JLIGHT
Introduction
Now you have reached, to a high degree, control over your own
personality,
including your physical body. You have also taken
the first important steps upon the path to the inner kingdom, to
the kingdom
of life and abundance.
Before
you advance
any
further, it will be necessary to guard yourself against surprises
which will interrupt your development
unpleasantly.
Such sur-
prises always occur by means of the senses. This results in the
rule: Post a Sentinel at the Gates of the Senses.
Post A Sentinel
At The
Gates Of the Senses
A guard with crossed halberds,
who does not allow such im-
pressions
to approach you and let them in, cannot do you any
harm. Therefore you should make a choice among all the things
you encounter.
You should concern
yourself
only with those
impressions
that you do not fear, those which cannot
disturb
....
your development.
The time will come when you do not require
83
these precautionary
measures because,
on the whole, you will
see and perceive this world quite differently
than you did be-
fore. But for the time being, you must proceed with caution be-
cause you are not yet sufficiently mature.
If possible,
avoid all noisy streets crowded
with excited
people. Do not look at store windows or displays which could
tempt you in accordance
with your own experience.
Do not lis-
ten to human beings who flatter you or otherwise play on your
weaknesses;
they are liars. Rather keep company, if necessary,
with good, valuable people, regardless
of the external
position
they may hold. Read good, serious
books. Listen
to or play
morally good music. In short, live a lifestyle
that keeps your
inner peace in an equilibrium.
Human beings of the opposite gender should only be con-
sidered as sisters or brothers. Do not look any longer than abso-
lutely necessary. The look is a procurer.
The Magic Of The Eye
It is absolutely necessary that you also obtain complete control
over the powers of your eyes.
The eye is far more than just the mirror of the soul. It is the
entrance
and exit of currents
of energy which you must keep
under complete control. The part the eye plays can be active or
passive in accordance with the frame of mind you are in; if you
are passive, then you are receptive to foreign influences,
and if
you allow another human being to look into your eyes while in
this condition, it will be easy for him to influence you. The per-
son who is speaking
is always more active than the one who
does not speak. Should he gaze into your eyes while speaking,
he has the upper hand or decided
advantage
from the start.
84
Through the eye, he sends unhindered
swarms of electrons
of
his commands suggestively
into your Innermost,
and if you are
not on guard you will be at a disadvantage.
In a way the eye is a light-telegraph
whose secret Morse
code
is accepted
by the
subconscious
of the
receiver
and
transforms it into deeds. Know that this telegraph also transmits
commands that are not spoken verbally. You have no guarantee
that these orders
or commands
will not harm you. Exercise
caution
consciously,
especially
when
in
the
presence
of
strangers: Allow no one who is speaking to you to look directly
into your eyes! Do not look at the person while he is speaking;
look inconspicuously
in another direction.
The more important
such a conversation
is, the more strictly you must follow this
rule.
If that person forces you in one way or another to look at
him, then do so, but in such a manner that you adjust your sight
into the far distance. In other words, do not look directly at that
person but at the background,
the area behind that person, only
for a moment.
Do not allow that person
under
any circum-
stances to catch your eye and detain it. Otherwise
he will cast
the wireless electric spark from his will into your brain. Always
remember that you, like an electric accumulator,
must remain in
a certain isolation
if you wish to travel your own path and re-
main free from foreign, uncontrollable
influences.
Any break-
through of this isolation will not only cause you to lose valuable
energy but, under certain circumstances,
deliver you to a hostile
power which will try to disturb any ascent, any harmonizing,
any crystalline
formation
within the serious practitioner.
The
human eye is the mightiest
seducer of evil as well as of good.
Only where you are as certain of your partner
as you are of
yourself may you make eye-to-eye contact.
85
This applies in instances of love, friendship,
and with peo-
ple to whom you are completely superior. It is of course advan-
tageous to observe strangers with whom you come into contact,
in order to gain an opinion. Choose a moment when they do not
look at you, when they are otherwise
occupied.
During
such
moments, cast your gaze like lightning at their faces, with the
conscious intent to look at them especially
sharply and exactly.
Study their features, their facial expressions,
their unconscious
little gestures.
After you have gained some practice,
you can
learn quite a bit from this observation.
However, the mighties1
method is the master look -
which protects you from strange
influences
on the one hand, and on the other hand gives you
superiority
and allows you to lend emphasis to your impressior
on others. This master look is also called the active or central
look.
The Development
Of
The Master Look
You will only be completely
successful
with this exercise
if it
goes hand in hand with the completion
of all the aforemen-
tioned exercises.
You cannot take one brick out of a building
and use it by itself; you must leave each brick in its place. That
way, you have a complete building. The master look is steadi-
ness itself and is firmly directed to one point. This point is be-
tween the eyebrows of the partner, directly above the bridge of
the nose. This is the point of fixation
upon which you must
learn to focus. Do not believe that you will acquire this superior
steadiness
and firmness
of the look without using this special
exercise.
The particulars
in regards to this exercise
follow in
the second part of this Letter. The effect of this central 1ook
86
upon your partner is that he will be under the impression
that
you are looking into his eyes with a penetrating
look, that you
are, as it were, looking through him. This look has the effect of
being something special, as you will soon notice in the behavior
of others. Such a person will treat you more considerately,
re-
spectfully,
and will be more obliging. You will have it easy if
you wish to influence such a person, no matter in which direc-
tion.
Application
Of
The Master Look
The master
look should
therefore
have an application
as an
excellent
remedy
against
the influence
of others.
Following
that, it should be an excellent
means of defense
against
the
attempts
of foreign
influences.
You should not use this look
frequently and indiscriminately,
but only when it is important to
you and you wish the effect to be especially
thorough.
When
you apply the master look, do so as inconspicuously
as possible,
and always only for a short time. The subject
should not be
aware that you are making use of an arbitrary technique.
Make
use of it occasionally
during
the course
of a conversation,
especially
when you wish to be penetratingly
effective through
your words. As a rule, your look should only be applied with a
particular
phrase,
in order
to lend
your
words
the
proper
emphasis. The proper application
requires an active disposition
of the soul. Make use of the master look based on the sense and
consciousness
of the following sentences: "I rest within myself!
I am accumulated
energy! I retain my energy! I make use of my
energy at my discretion!"
87
When required,
bear in mind also that thoughts which are
not spoken can be transferred
to another
person
through
the
master
look. The master look emanates
immediately
into the
physical
central seat of the divine genius of the other person.
The genius receives it and also reads those thoughts that are not
spoken. The genius reads these thoughts without the necessity
that they should reach the other person's
earthly consciousness
immediately.
Should these thoughts be bad, the genius in the
other person will make certain that they are communicated
or
become conscious to him in the form of a warning, a presenti-
ment or something similar. The other person will become suspi-
cious, careful and fearful when he thinks about his relationship
with you, and he will be reserved and stay away from you and
you will not be the receiver
of the advantages
you had hoped
for.
Be always aware of the tremendous
responsibility
which
lies in the nature of the master look. Because thoughts that you
have not verbalized
can be passed over without your will, you
may sooner or later harm yourself. Make it a strict rule that you
only make use of the master look with feelings of kindness or
benevolence
towards
the other person;
in other words,
with
honest feelings. The genius in human beings is omniscient
and
cannot be deceived by a mask.
The Discipline
Of A Wish
Always
be aware that you, together
with all other creatures,
form a large body, the macrocosm, and that you as well as they
are regarded as an organ of this exalted body. But if one organ
places
itself
above
the others,
then
it does not do its task
88
correctly
and appropriately.
It requires more nourishment
than
what it is entitled to. It withdraws energies and fluids from the
whole which are above the permitted proportions.
Through this
the
entire
body
suffers
and,
in the
end,
the
organ
which
committed
this
wicked
deed
itself.
Sooner
or
later
the
consequence
is
a defensive
reaction
by
the
central
body
(macrocosm)
against
that particular
organ.
The central
body
first attempts
to heal the organ, but, when healing
is for one
reason
or another
impossible,
it eradicates
it without
mercy.
lllness, grief, pain and catastrophes
are healing processes which
are necessary
wherever
they appear.
Do not resist
evil! Say
"yes!" to suffering! Bear patiently whatever happens to you as
far
as catastrophes
are
concerned.
They
are
the
cleansing
tempests which the central body sends over your life. These are
the means of the spirit to obtain recognition for his will.2
Your most important
practical
life task is your conscious
integration
into this higher
will. This integration
must be a
complete one; it must encompass your entire thinking and aspi-
rations
and it must begin with the wish. You know that the
thought of wishing is the prime deed, the determining
action, in
everything
you undertake. Draw your conclusions
from the fol-
lowing: Do not wish anything that could harm and disadvantage
your fellow men. Be always conscious of the fact that they are a
part of the central body to which you belong as well. They are
ocean
water j list like you and, though
poured
into different
bowls from the great ocean, they are, from the ocean's
point of
view, you yourself! Become more and more aware of the great
unity, grow into it as into a new condition
of the soul. And
above all: Hate No One!
2 Laws. - ED.
89
Hate No  One
All things and beings came forth from the universal God-Spirit.
If you hate or despise them, then you hate and despise God. And
since you also belong to the great unity, you therefore
hate
yourself as well.
You should not even hate the so-called
"evil,"
for it is
made from the spirit, just like you, and sent into the world with
its particular
task. This task is often that of destruction,
annihi-
lation
and transformation.
Yes, evil is incarnate
annihilation
itself. It is the most cruel, radical servant, the hardest, most un-
merciful tool of the spirit. But you should not hate it any more
than you would hate a bacillus pestis. Of course, being free of
hate does not mean that you should
submit yourself
to evil
without a defense. You were put into your place to fight, and
only with a struggle will you attain perfection.
Know that the
"evil" which is put into your path is to be your best teacher to-
wards perfection.
And use the following phrase as a guideline:
Fear Nothing!
Fear Nothing
The might that created you and led you into the world knows
the reason why. It also knows the best path for you to take. Eve-
rything that you encounter
comes out of its hands. The whole
universe is your Father's
house. Why should you fear anything
which, like you, lives in your Father's
house?
The high primordial
force from which you yourself came
forth created the other beings, and if it puts them in your path,
then that occurs with a certain intention.
And this means that
you must recognize
this divine
intention.
Nine-tenths
of all
90
things that human beings fear are based purely on illusion and
will never occur; they are only an entirely unnecessary
burden
for the soul. Therefore
never allow these shadowy thoughts
to
be the cause of your fears.
Not to fear anything does not mean to rush towards danger.
The further you develop yourself,
the more often will you be
privy to warnings of real dangers. Listen to such warnings with-
out being fearful
because
of them. The more you live in the
feeling of unity, the closer you are to its omniscience.
The Great Brotherhood
Everything
alive forms a great brotherhood.
Bear in mind that
everything
that exists in the world is necessary,
otherwise
it
would not have been created. All beings, from infusoria
to the
stars, are your life's companions
and your blood relatives.
You
are closely connected to all of them in the spirit. Absolute good
will towards
all beings of this world should be a high com-
mandment
for you and should become a dear habit. Moderate
your "I" point of view. Observe what you encounter
and who
you encounter from the other's point of view and also with the
sense of another's
understanding.
Also include animals into this
kind of observation,
especially
when they are close to you and
your house.
No human being and no animal is "low"; all of them carry
the royal mark, the artistic mark of the creative
spirit on their
foreheads.
Learn to see it! What changes is only the task and
therefore the form. All beings are single sounds in the immense
symphony of the universe. If you want to understand
them and
yourself
properly,
you must be informed
about the rhythmic
laws which rule the world.

The Teachings Of Rhythm
All life is motion. And all motion has a rhythm. The sunspot-
maxima and -minima to which the earthly periods of war and
peace are so significantly
synchronized
appear at regular inter-
vals. The planets rotate in regulated periods of time around the
sun. On earth, day and night change with the accuracy of clock-
work.
"Und schnell
and unbegreiflich
schnelle
Dreht
sich umher
der Erde Pracht.
Es wechselt
Paradieseshelle
Mit tiefer,
schauervoller
Nacht!
. . ."
(Goethe)
"Quick, incomprehensibly
quick
the Earth's splendor rotates about.
It changes Paradise's
luminosity
into a deep, dreadful night!"
Human beings with their entire being are also integrated
into this immense
world rhythm.
They are at the same time
woof and weaver in this wonderful
fabric; these cosmic ener-
gies which, as angels of the Highest, hold the destiny and life of
everything
that came into being in their hands, are active even
within them.
92
The Fundamental Thought
Of Astrology
You are aware of the effectiveness
of the sun's energy on earth
in everything alive. Now contemplate
on the effectiveness
of all
the other constellations.
You know, for instance, the earth's
re-
lationship of ebb and tide to the moon.3 Have you ever thought
about the fact that a woman carries the lunar rhythm within her-
self in the form of her menstrual cycle? In a manner of speak-
ing, she is a part of the ocean herself. It is, however, important
to know that the cycle of her organism does not coincide with
the time of the high points of movements of the ocean (spring
tide). Rather, a woman carries within herself this lunar rhythm,
lunar movement, lunar energy; she is herself, so to speak, a par-
tial moon. Fertility,
illness, death and all organic change is, as
Dr. Fliess has proven, closely connected to the female number
28 and the male number 23, and it is carried out in a multitude
of combinations
of these numbers.
The planets as a rule are farther removed from us than the
sun and the moon, the "lights"
of astrology.
In spite of that,
they are still intimately
connected
to us. The sun is not as
strong in the winter when it is closer to the earth, but in the
summer when it is farther away. The degree of effectiveness
is
dependent upon the angle at which it shines upon the earth or a
part of the earth. Therefore
the astrological
significance
of a
planet fundamentally
depends upon its angular position.
When
an
angular
position
of 90  degrees is considered
to be extremely
3 The moon does not influence ebb and tide. For complete details, re-
fer to Earth & Moon, by Jakob Lorber. - ED.
93
unfavorable  and an angular postion of  
120° exceptionally
favorable,
this is not a mere supposition
but is based
on a
thousandfold
incidents of practical experience
rather than upon
some arbitrary
theoretical
combination.
You must imagine the
manner in which this is effective
to be just the same as was
mentioned
in regards
to the moon. A part of this planetary
energy is incorporated
into the earthly organism,
and the kind
and direction of this inner implanted rhythm -
which can never
be lost -
depends upon the respective positions
of the planets
and constellations
at the moment of birth. The higher self, the
divine genius who guides and regulates
every new incarnation
of a human being,
not only determines
the procreation
and
conception
through
the chosen parents,
but also, through
the
choice
of the proper
celestial
moment,
gives
this child
the
necessary
abilities and inner rhythm to fulfill its special tasks.
This moment coincides with the moment of the first breath.
Indeed, how much the entire firmament has helped with the
earthly
garment
of every newly incarnated
individual
proves
that the structure of the physical appearance
and personal char-
acter is fundamentally
very much dependent
upon the sign of
the zodiac which, at the time of birth, was ascending
on the
eastern horizon. These are also established
facts that have been
ascertained
through observation
and been proven in countless
cases.
You can imagine all these effects of the stars as immense
dynamos, which orbit in the skies and, in accordance
with their
positions
in relationship
to each other and the earth, mutually
strengthen,
weaken
or
combine
with
each
other
in
their
inductive
effect. On the basis of accurate
astronomical
charts
that are interpreted
in accordance with many thousands of years
of
experience,
these
interrelations
can
be
calculated
and
composed,
so to speak, like a weather map for each individual;
94
its consideration
can only
be an advantage.
A great SCIence
based on the most accurate observation has newly arisen, which
in truth deserves to be called the "queen of the sciences."
It is
this science
which gives us the last astral completion
of our
world picture, our view of life. The signs of the zodiac, as the
symbols of our inner life and our wishes, our possibilities
and
limits,
are the proceeds
of the recognition
of astrology.
The
inner rhythm coincides with the exalted rhythm of the heavenly
spheres,
and upon this the last and profoundest
cognition
is
based, and the self-mastery
of a human being makes him the
master even over catastrophic
constellations.
"In your breast are
the stars of your destiny!"
The Secret Of Breathing
The integration
of human beings
into this cosmic periodical
clockwork
-
which is periodically
ticking away -
is carried
out by means of breathing and begins with the first breath. Only
breathing,
which is of itself a rhythmic procedure,
sets the en-
tire mechanism
of the organism in motion. It is the great fly-
wheel by which the heavenly periodicity,
the will of the stars,
transfers
itself
automatically
to
the
individual.
Heartbeat,
bloodstream,
circulation
of the fluids,
bowel movements,
all
depend on breathing. Be master of your breathing and you will
be master of your entire inner rhythm. The significance
of this
in the final analysis
will become clear through the following
considerations.
95
The Periodicity Of Destiny
Even
what is characterized
as your "destiny"
follows
strict
rhythmic laws which have their analogy, their substantiation,
in
the whole heavenly mechanism. Here particular numbers playa
primary role, namely 7, 9 and 12, but there are also longer cy-
cles. It is absolutely
necessary
to divide and observe your life
from this point of view. Do this in the following manner:
In a quiet moment, reflect on your entire life. Be as accu-
rate as possible in regards to those points in time which consti-
tuted your internal
and external
changes,
especially
the main
events
of your
life.
Then
establish
continuous
periodic
se-
quences in which you place seven years of your life on the first
line. In other words, if you were born in 1870, then you will
have the years 1870 to 1876 on the first line of your chart; the
second line will have the years 1877 to 1883; the third line will
have 1884 to 1890 and so forth. You should have seven col-
umns across, and under the year 1870 you will have the years
1877, 1884 and so on in the second line. Under the year 1871
you will have 1878, 1885 and so on. Under the year 1872, you
will have 1879, 1886 and so on.
The next task will be to research
these vertical
columns
and find the connections
between them. As soon as you have
found the common thread, it will become clear to you that in
your life -
always in intervals of seven years -
certain ten-
dencies reoccur, whether they be family influences, professional
changes, directions
of your inner life, etc., and you will recog-
nize how old things reoccur in a new form; how your entire life,
so to speak, develops in an ascending spiral. The spiral always
has the same fundamental
sound; however,
it produces
ever
higher octaves and new variations.
96
Proceed in the same manner with the number 9 as well as
with other numbers.
One number may be of particular
impor-
tance in a certain individual's
life, yet in another life it is an-
other number.
We will now begin with the practical part of the exercises
of the fourth step.
To Lose Everything
Means
To Find Everything
The motto inscribed above is valid not only for this step, but to
an increased
degree for all the other steps into which you will
gradually
grow. Beforehand,
this sentence
disclosed
to you a
primary result of your exercises,
and now gives that result to
you in a very short form, because it is advantageous
to be re-
minded anew by fanfare at certain points on your path.
Practical
Studies
1. Begin the day with a standard series of breathing
(des-
tiny breathing) exercises.

during chewing and swallowing.
97
6. Practice
one of the following
three exercises
daily in
sequence:
(a) meditation on the "World Father."
(b) meditation on the "World Mother."
(c) the empathy exercise on "my fellow man."
Explanations
In addition
to the above instructions,
the following
directions
for their execution are given:
(1) Complete Breathing Exercises: First, assume a position
of complete rest, either on a bed, a comfortable
chair or a re-
cliner. Close your eyes, relax, and direct your entire attention to
your breathing. Remove all other thoughts; do not think of any-
thing else.
Complete
breathing
can be compared
to a wave
which swells from the bottom to the top. When you first begin
to breathe,
let the abdomen bulge out, followed
by the lower
and eventually
the upper chest region. This is accomplished
by
slowly counting from 1 to 3 in your mind. When you reach the
number 4, hold your breath. At 5, 6, and 7, pull in and extend
your abdomen with every count.4 Having reached number 8, be-
gin to exhale slowly until you have reached the count of 12.
Remember that all counting is done in your mind, not verbally.
After each of these complete breathing exercises, take a regular
breath to avoid any over-exertion.
In order that the breathing
may be properly
carried
out,
your attention
must be directed
completely
towards
the exer-
cise. Once this mechanism
has been properly
trained,
which
4 Like a rolling motion from the abdomen to the chest. - ED.
98
should be the case after approximately
4 to 5 complete breaths,
then let the following
thought flash through your mind while
breathing: In the manner in which I now breathe, I will form my
destiny!
Twelve
repetitions
forms one series.
Each morning
you
should carry out at least one series, but do not exceed 20.
The purpose of this destiny breathing
is twofold. First of
all, a thorough massage of particular internal parts of the organ-
ism, inclusive of the sympathicus,5 is carried out, especially
of
the abdominal
organs. Then you will build a mental bridge to
the energies that form your destiny, which have sensuous-tactile
images in the rhythm of your organism. In order to be effective
upon the invisible,
it is of benefit
to make use of sensuous-
tactile symbolic pictures.
The Training
Of The
Master Look
2(a) The Basic Mirror Exercise: Draw a dot approximately
l/4 inch or larger directly above the bridge of your nose.6 Sit in a
comfortable
position,
rigid and erect, in front of a mirror at a
distance of about 31/2 feet, and fix your eyes on the dot without
blinking. Your facial expression
should be friendly, and it will
also be advantageous
to put yourself
into a friendly
mood so
that the expression
is unforced. Begin this exercise with 2 min-
utes and increase it by I minute every day to a maximum of 10
minutes. Over a period of time, increase the distance gradually
to approximately
7 feet.
5 The sympathetic nervous system. - ED.
6 A round sticker may also be used. - ED.
99
(b) The Head Movement Exercise:
This requires
the same
preparation
and seating position as in exercise (a) above. Turn
your head to the left as far as you can without losing sight of
the dot above the bridge of your nose. Once you have reached
this point, remain in this position
for a moment, then slowly
return to your starting position.7 Repeat the same procedure
by
turning your head to the right. Also, this exercise has to be exe-
cuted without blinking
your eyes, and without removing
your
gaze from the mirror. This exercise should not take longer than
half a minute. Repeat this exercise
a second time and then a
third time. In the beginning,
do not attempt this exercise more
than three times, because it is fairly strenuous. In order to avoid
confusion
in regards to this exercise,
I will explain it in more
detail. Since this exercise has to be done every third day, it is
recommended
that on the first day you should pause between
sets of 3. Each subsequent exercise -
every third day -
the set
should be increased
by one rotation,
with no pause between
sets.
(c) The Picture Exercise:
Set up three pictures
or photo-
graphs of different people around you in such a manner that one
photograph is in front of you, the second one to the side of you,
and the third behind you. Your position should be the same as
in exercises
(a) and (b) above. Begin the exercise with the pic-
ture in front of you by focusing for a while freely and without
restraint
upon the dot above the bridge of the nose. Then turn
around quickly on your chair and seek with lightning
speed to
focus in on the same point on the second photo. Eventually
do
the same with the picture behind you. Change the position
of
7 One set. - ED.
100
the pictures often. It is advantageous
to speak to the people in
the pictures as if they were living human beings. Always main-
tain a posture
and countenance
of kindness
or friendliness.
Also, your eyes should remain motionless
during this exercise,
which means that you should not blink. Should you be inclined
to blink or to close your eyes, then refer to what has been said
earlier in this book about that subject. (Raise your upper eyelids
and, if necessary,
wash your eyes with lukewarm
water, or an
infusion of chamomile tea.)
(3) The Cosmic Eye Exercise: This exercise is not one that
has to be practiced at a particular time of the day; it is a general
exercise for the entire day. Become entirely one with the con-
cept that everything
which surrounds
you is an immense
eye,
which constantly looks at you and observes you. It looks at you
through
all other human beings, through the animals, through
the entire world that surrounds you and with which you come in
touch. During the course of the day, make this clear to yourself
repeatedly
at every opportunity.
Imagine
how the world eye
looks at you and examines you through the eyes of human be-
ings and animals. What does it see in you? What would you like
to see in yourself?
Ask yourself
these
questions
again
and
agam.
In a way, all beings are, so to speak, living lenses of this
cosmic eye. Friends and foes, acquaintances
and relatives, dogs,
horses, cats, etc., are not as they appear to you. Without being
aware of it themselves,
they have another purpose which they
fulfill as tools of the spirit. They come out of the unknown, ex-
amine you, and return to the unknown. Through them the cos-
mic spirit himself gazes upon you.
101
Not only does the cosmic spirit look at you through human
beings and animals, but also through your entire surroundings.
The universal
energy which created the eyes of the beings is
itself an eye. It is an immense eye which surrounds you in the
form of sun and rain, wind and storm, forest and heath. In all
the things that surround you, it looks upon you and accepts and
records
all your life's
expressions
and manifestations.
Even
your thoughts
do not remain hidden from this all-penetrating
cosmic eye. Be always conscious of this fact right to the depth
of your being.
The light of the sun is only a symbol for this immense eye.
Its light is above the light of all suns. Even the night itself is not
dark for this eye.
"The darkness
itself
would not be dark to you, and the
night shines like the day. And the darkness is like the light!"
Therefore,
be in awe in the presence
of this seeing,
all-
encompassing
energy. The finest and highest that is within you
is a part of it. The most profound and the last within you gives
you the answer to the question about the thousands of "others."
(4) The Cosmic Food Exercise: This exercise is to be prac-
ticed during your meals and is divided into two parts, which are
joined together without constraint.
1. Giving Thanks.
2. The Breaking of Bread.
Giving thanks takes place by making it clear to yourself, in
the presence
of your food and drink, from whence they origi-
nally came and how far this nourishment
has traveled
until it
has reached your table. You should not eat like an animal in the
102
barn which devours
its food greedily
and thoughtlessly.
You
should eat like a fully conscious person who knows his position
in the house of his Father.
.
Ponder, for example, how the grain in the fields ripened
through the marriage with the sun's energy, in order to give you
flour and bread. Because if this ripening had not been meant for
you personally,
you would not have had any bread today; nei-
ther would you have any tomorrow. Ponder how milk is given to
you from the abundance of the cows, how the cows eat the grass
in the meadows, which the rain and sun let grow. Who sent the
rain and the sun so that you are given the milk? Have no doubt
that the milk is a message, a gift, of higher authorities.
If there
were to be a failure of crops, a failure in growth in the country,
you would have nothing to eat and drink. Whatever you eat is
given to you. You must give thanks.
Those who bring you all these things are only the organs of
the actual provider which carries it out. He allows all the ele-
ments to work together, whether it be in your homeland or in a
foreign country. He makes it fruitful so that you are helped, be-
cause He wants you to live!
Certainly, it is proper to pay for your food. But the money
to buy it is given to you by other people. It is certainly proper,
in order to obtain money, that you perform your regular work.
But your healthy
limbs and organs, your thinking
mind with
which you accomplish
this, again are given to you. That is the
reason for giving thanks.
The breaking of bread takes place by consciously
calling
forth a profound
feeling
of thanksgiving.
Take all your food
with a particular sense of awe. Never believe that one morsel of
food is insignificant.
See in everything the spirit of the provider
which is given to you in every morsel, and who makes His love
103
known to you through this. Think often while dining about what
you eat and drink. Within this lies a secret which you must dis-
cover through your own introspection.
These thoughts
should remain
with you while you chew
and swallow. Seek to accompany each bite with the thought that
you are now taking in organized
all-encompassing
cosmic en-
ergy.
(5)Autosuggestion
During
Chewing
And
Swallowing:
It
would be appropriate
to utilize your chewing
and swallowing
movements
for the integration
of autosuggestion.
When
you
charge these bodily rhythms with thought-energy,
it enters you
and your being with the greatest imaginable promptness.
In this
manner the finer energy system is integrated
with the coarser
system and has, as you will see from experience,
a more lasting
effect.
I recommend
this method,
but not in every instance;
however, it can be used occasionally.
For example,
should you not be punctual
and not sleep
well, charge your chewing motion with the words: "I am punc-
tual!" Repeat this sentence again and again until you have fin-
ished chewing whatever is in your mouth. Then swallow it with
the vivid imagination:
"I now ingest punctuality.
I take it in as a
lasting component of my being!"
Following that, do the same with the sentence: "I am sleep-
ing better every day!" When you swallow your food after chew-
ing it properly, imagine vividly that with this food you take in
sleeping energy.
For this purpose and intention it is best served to eat your
meals alone, at least when you want to achieve
these things.
Should
this not be possible,
then you can do such practices
unnoticed while in the presence of company. It is necessary that
104
your participation
in conversation
should be somewhat limited,
in other words that you internally withdraw from the other peo-
ple at the table and indulge in your particular
thoughts
which
belong only to you.
These autosuggestions
can be employed
for any purpose.
Should you by nature lack love for your fellow man, lack kind-
ness to animals, lack gentleness,
lack the ability of perception
for a particular area of knowledge, as for instance for these par-
ticular
Hermetic
letters of instruction,
then make use of this
method. You will find it to your satisfaction.
However, do not
forget to form short, precise and positive sentences before you
begin this project.
Breathing
exercises
in this respect
can be
employed
to a much higher degree. How this is to be accom-
plished will be learned later.
6(a) Meditation
on the Cosmic Father: Do the major con-
centration.
Once you have reached the first, passive phase, im-
merse yourself most profoundly
into this sequence of pictures:
Imagine the image of your natural father. Call forth all the feel-
ings of respect and love which you had when you were a child
and which you may still feel now. If you did not know your fa-
ther or he did not measure
up to this standard
in your life,
choose instead any other man who was or still is to you a person
of respectability.
Now imagine him to be naked and bare. Imagine precisely
all the details of his body, the torso, the limbs in all their fine
details.
Once that is done, imagine his appearance
continuing
to
increase in size, first to about the size of a house -
like a huge
giant
standing
before
you. In your imagination
enhance
this
image further!
In the next step, increase
his size to that of a
105
mountain
-
superhuman
contours
come into being
and the
familiar features become difficult to recognize. Are not the feet
rooted into the ground like immense bedrock?
Have the arms
not become long stretched-out
mountain crests, and has not the
hair
become
forests?
And
the eye
a clear
mountain
lake?
Imagine all this and enhance it in every detail.
Now this giant is growing into something colossal. He is as
large as a continent.
Then he becomes as large as our globe;
then as large as the solar system. Imagine all this step by step,
and enhance it in detail as well as you can. What dimensions!
What changes in this particular
form, if you view it from your
human point of view! And yet it is your father. Repeat this with
every picture you imagine, and still it is your father. Conclude
this meditation by reciting The Lord's Prayer in your mind.
(b) Meditation
on the Cosmic Mother: Begin this exercise
just as with the previous one, with the difference that in the sec-
ond phase you imagine your mother instead of your father, or if
necessary
a female person who represents
to you a person you
respected or still respect. Also imagine this person to be naked
and bare in every detail. Then follow the above description
in
every detail. Conclude this meditation by reciting the following
words
in your
mind:
"Cosmic
Mother,
I salute
you!
Holy
Mother, bless me!"
(c) Empathy Exercise -
My Fellow Man: First practice the
passive phase of the major concentration.
Then direct your in-
ner attention
to the individual
who, in your opinion,
is your
worst enemy. Should you not have one, then choose a person
you know whom you consider to be very unpleasant,
whether
male or female.
106
Imagine this person in every detail in the manner described
in the previous exercises. Imagine his or her facial features, his
or her deportment,
his or her manner of speaking. All this has to
be done without
any emotion,
purely factually,
sober-minded
and objective. Do not cling too much to details as such, but seek
to grasp the general expression,
which results from team-work
of the whole. Keep mainly with the good and pleasant
attrib-
utes.
Then call forth within you a feeling of love for all beings.
Embrace
your "enemy"
with these warm feelings.
Internally
become accustomed to his being, his way of thinking; enter into
his soul. While doing this, remain relaxed. The most important
thing is the sympathetic
emotional
attitude.
Only through love
will you be able to reach the proximity of the other person spiri-
tually. This is the art of the soul, wherein one person is more
successful than another.
Once you have felt the waves of warm feelings of sympa-
thy, then adopt a passive and vacant state of mind, assume a
receptive
posture
and wait quietly. Do not expect anything
in
particular.
If you have done everything properly and if you have
reached maturity, you will receive the innermost
thoughts
and
feelings of your "enemy" like lightning.
All his or her secrets
will be like an open book and you will be able to recognize
them thoroughly.
For the time being, you will have knowledge
of a part of that person's
soul, and through repetition
you will
come into the knowledge
of other parts of the content
of his
soul.
This may occur for one person in the form of a wordless
recognition;
all of a sudden you just "know it." Another person
may experience
it in the form of a sentence
which he or she
hears, or in the form of a picture which he or she sees internally
107
and which is mainly to be understood
symbolically.
This sym-
bolism corresponds exactly with the symbolism of dreams.
The decision
as to whether the goal of the exercises
has
been reached lies with an infallible
inner feeling. You will be
able to see through any human being or object with which you
are "one."
The entire
exercise
is divided
into the following
main parts:
(l)The
passive phase of the major concentration.
(2)The active phase, consisting of:
(a)
The preparation
of the mental image of the person
chosen.
(b)
The awakening of the feeling and the active send-
ing out of sympathy.
(c)
Deliberate vacancy and passivity.
This meditation
can also be practiced
out of sequence,
if
the circumstances
are such that it becomes desirable.
This will
be especially
advantageous
before important
meetings
and ne-
gotiations
with acquaintances
or strangers. These exercises
are
always to be performed fairly late in the evening just before you
go to bed or just before you fall asleep.
Your daily schedule should therefore be as follows:
Your early morning exercises:
Record your dreams.
A series of complete breathing exercises.
The training of the master look.
108
Your exercises during the course of the day:
The cosmic eye exercise.
The cosmic food exercise.
Your evening exercises:
Meditation
on the Cosmic Father or the Cosmic Mother or
the Empathy Exercise.
Daily criticism and making plans for the next day.

LIGHT
A Warning Which Should
Be Taken Seriously
Only one who enjoys total health of the physical body and soul
should enter into the exercises of the fifth level. Exceptionally
weak human beings, namely those who suffer from consuming
or mental
ailments,
especially
from obsession
and the like,
should refrain from the exercises that follow, since they could
cause serious harm.
Should a person who is afflicted with the above ailments
decide to continue, and begin with the exercises that follow, the
author
of
these

declines
any
moral
responsibilities.

All those who, on the basis of this warning,
are not in a
position
to continue
our course of instruction
have it within
their power to lead a rich and fruitful life. All they have to do is
remain on the path they have entered
and, as far as time and
energy allow, immerse themselves
for a few years in the study
of astrology
or chirology
and they will be richly
rewarded.
Learning
either
of these subjects
by themselves
can take an
entire lifetime.
However,
my other
companions
who have reached
this
point and who are in full possession
of healthy energies,
come
now and take my hand and allow yourself to be helped to climb
to the fifth level. Above all: Learn Silence!
Learn Silence
The world in which we live echoes with infinite idle talk. The
more the words that are spoken, the fewer the deeds that are
performed.
In a sense, words become
a substitute
for deeds;
what is even worse, the word nips the deed in the bud. How-
ever,
all things
which
shall
become
tangible
reality
in the
physical world must have time in the spiritual world before they
mature, precisely as a child must mature in the mother's
womb
before it sees the light of day; otherwise
it will perish on ac-
count of its own internal imperfection.
The best method
to insure
failure,
when it comes
to a
thought or plan, is to speak about it prematurely.
Not only are
you giving away living energy, which would, if retained, main-
tain the tendency to perfect itself and to serve the thinking hu-
man being, but you also awaken, on the basis of one's own psy-
chological
law, immediate
upcoming counter forces which op-
pose the immature neophyte in the spiritual kingdom and seek
110
to destroy
him. A finished,
completed
fact is a might
with
which everyone must deal in one manner or another. It enters
the world
as a knight
in armor and fights
for its position.
Whereas
an immature fact is a helpless infant which is easily
overpowered.
The discipline
of silence
is one of the most important
weapons in the struggle for happiness
and success, one which
you cannot do without in the struggle for the ineffable bliss of
self-perfection.
Much has been said and written about the art of
speaking, but very little about the art of silence. And yet it is an
ability that has to be practiced regularly. The person that speaks
seems to be at an advantage
when viewed superficially.
The
reason for this is that a speaking person awakens the impression
of activity
and is more active in actuality
than the silent lis-
tener. Be assured that this superiority
is only overt until it is
confronted
by a disciplined
person, in other words, a taciturn
person who does not indiscriminately
surrender to his partner,
but instead
is very particular
when selecting
the people
or
words by which he wishes to be influenced.
From this moment
on it should be a rule for you that you should ask yourself these
questions
regarding
every human being with whom you come
into contact:
"Can he or she influence
me positively
or nega-
tively?9 Does he promote or obstruct my progress on the path
which I have entered upon?" Conduct yourself accordingly!
Active And Passive
Silence
Passive silence is allowed if it is conducive
to your advance-
ment; you can subject yourself to the influence of conversation
9 A person or words or both. - ED.
111
without
mental reservations.
You can listen with feelings
of
sympathy
and consent.
However,
should these feelings
influ-
ence you unfavorably and obstruct your development,
or should
you have any reason to believe that they might, then immedi-
ately initiate active silence with your full consciousness;
that is,
practice silence with inner reservation.
As long as you are sub-
jected or exposed to such people or thoughts, be firm and hold
on to the idea: "You cannot harm me, you cannot influence me,
I am on guard!" It would, however, be more practical to abbre-
viate this to a short catch-phrase
such as: "I am absolutely unin-
fluenceable !"
Be especially on guard during times of depression,
despon-
dency, despair
and illness.
You are very easily influenced
in
this state. Be especially careful under these circumstances;
wear
the armor of active silence and keep the entrance to your soul
closed. The more a stranger tries to persuade you while you are
in this condition, the more careful and reserved you should be.
While in this condition,
do not accept any suggestions
unless
they are the encouraging
suggestions of true friends!
But your task is not limited to this. In addition to these gen-
eral instructions
of silence, there are particular
ones which will
make
you the master
of your
tongue
and represent
a new
accumulation
exercise.
Restrict Your Speech Daily
For One Hour
For one hour daily, speak only when absolutely necessary.
Pon-
der whether or not each word and sentence should be uttered,
and therefore speak slowly and deliberately.
All talk just for the
sake of talking is thereby omitted. Think of those monks who
112
exercise their speech only one day a year and lead a useful and
blessed life in spite of it.
The effect of this procedure
is manifold.
You will recog-
nize with convincing
severity the worthless
rhetoric
in which
most of humankind
is engaged.
You will soon learn how to
separate the wheat from the chaff and be amazed by the lack of
ideas around you. Your fellow man will approach
you much
more attentively,
and deal with your words with more respect,
the sounder they are and the more they contain.
The main value of this exercise lies within the significant
saving of energy, and the inner increase of energy you will ex-
perience on account of it. Every word impulse which you sup-
press
accumulates
as psycho-electric
energy
within
you,
in-
creases your astral resiliency,
and therefore
serves your higher
purpose.
Practical
Application
It stands to reason that this entire change in your manner of
speaking has to come about as inconspicuously
as possible.
In
everything that you say, remain very courteous and obliging; in
everything
you do, be pleasant and kind. No one should notice
any particular purpose.
Choose
a different
hour every day: today,
for instance,
from 8:00 - 9:00 A.M., tomorrow from 9:00 - 10:00 A.M. and so
on. Continue this until you have practiced each hour throughout
the entire day. Take, of course, those hours which are available
to you when you are in the presence of people, so that you can
practice this exercise.
Once you have gone through a series of
one-hour exercises, extend the exercise time to two hours daily,
whether two consecutive
hours or one hour in the morning and
113
one in the afternoon.
Eventually
it could be the entire morning
or the entire afternoon.
Should this exercise become a habit, it
does no harm; as a matter of fact, it will only be of benefit to
you.
If you are very talkative by nature, help yourself over the
first hurdle by writing, so to speak, a monologue,
whereby you
let off steam. You can also carryon
such a monologue
while
you are out in nature, when no one is around. In the beginning,
it will give you a certain balance while things are still difficult.
Bear in mind that this is only allowed in the beginning,
while
you are waiting for its full effect. Only total effort will bring
total benefits. Whoever cannot be silent in the manner described
is not ready for any further exercises.
The Fortunes
Of Hunger
By now you must have experienced
that your dietary restric-
tions have had beneficial effects. Now it is absolutely necessary
to intensify these efforts to a certain degree. The organism must
be free of any waste if it wants to become a true vessel for
higher energies. Never has anything great come forth from con-
tented people or nations. You have to eat less and smaller por-
tions if you want to lead your spirit to his ultimate energy of
increased
preparedness
for activities.
Has not a full stomach
brought nothing more than idle worthless thoughts? Quieta non
movere! (What rests, let it rest) was from time immemorial
the
motto of the well-fed.
Bear in mind that the individualized
spirit is a fighting or-
gan which is given to humankind
to conquer
its place in the
universe. This place is not necessarily for the well-fed; they fall
asleep very easily, become weary and degenerate.
On the other
114
hand, the hungry are alert, awake and industrious.
To this day
the true poets still live in the attic. The bird sings until the
young ones are in the nest. Hunger and need create the inventor,
yet
selfishness
and
dissatisfaction
create
the
revolutionary.
Hunger and need strike with a hard fist unto the brazen rings
which everyone carries around his heart from birth so that they
break and liberate the human being for the rhythm, the healing
currents,
of the great unity. John and Jesus and thousands
of
hermits and many before and after them knew why they went
into the desert where they nourished
themselves
meagerly be-
fore they began their exalted missions. . .
Human beings seem to fear nothing more than hunger, yet
it is the best spice of life. Yes, it is even more: it is the ladder of
ascent and the lever of all development.
The migration of entire
nations
and the structure
of entire
cultures
began
and were
caused by it. May you too enter into a foreign country, may you
too build yourself
up, and may you therefore
not fear hunger.
Instead, take it into your service as a valuable friend.
One Month Of Fasting
It is a prerequisite
that under no circumstances
should you al-
low yourself to be weakened, emaciated and reduced to misery.
When it comes to any kind of fasting, there are limits which
cannot be violated
if you want to avoid serious harm. These
limits express themselves
in your subjective
state of health; as
long as you feel fresh and able to work, as long as you are not
"skin and bones" and you still have a distinct
layer of fat on
your body from which you can draw, then the limits have not
been surpassed.
On the other hand, always remember
that you
should not become a hunger fanatic;
instead you should be a
115
wise administrator
of your body, which you discipline
as a
teacher would his student.
Practical
Application
Twice a week, have a soup day wherein your main meals consist
only of liquid nourishment.
You can still eat bread for light
lunches
but meat in any form is strictly
forbidden.
Milk and
eggs are allowed. It goes without saying that fat and oils of all
kinds are included;
you have to place special emphasis
on the
intake of a sufficient
amount of fat. Fat is indispensable
for
nerves that are used excessively.
Preferably,
use only vegetable
fats if at all possible.1O The soups which replace
solid food
should have nutritional
content and be of value to the human
body. For their preparation,
use legumes
and alternate
these
with corn or flour products
of all kinds,
such as oats or oat
flakes,
buckwheat,
grits, semolina,
cream of wheat, pearl- or
pot-barley,
sago, rice, etc. And, of course, fruit should be eaten
every day.
All these instructions
in regards to food must be fulfilled
with your heart and soul, with an inner preparedness,
not some-
thing to which you subject yourself unwillingly,
such as home-
work. Only when this is done wholeheartedly
does it meet the
requirements
of this task -
the psycho-physical
refinement
of
your entire organism. If one opposing element remains in your
soul, it will act as an opposing part, a hindrance to your devel-
opment, and it will delay and influence your progress until that
element is completely eliminated.

So much for the general instructions
of this step; the spe-
cial instructions
result from the following points of view.
The Path To Your Innermost
~
Your Path To God
In order to find
yourself,
you must leave yourself
in order to
return again as a transformed
person. You can only leave your-
self and you will only find yourself when you change your spiri-
tual center of gravity, when you have "died" here in order to
awaken there, because only through "death" will human beings
achieve rebirth.
You must sacrifice
your little "I" in order to
find the great "I." But you will only achieve this feat, and will
only decide to make this sacrifice, when you take the ardently
desired yearning for the divine as your nourishment
while on
this path, because the promise as it was made in ancient times is
still valid today: "If thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt
find Him if thou seek Him with all thy heart! . . ." Also, should
you seek with your whole heart, then all the instructions
that
follow and which I can give you will be a helping hand and a
new step which you will probably find in an instant, when you
least expected.
The Sons Of The
Primordial
Light
In the beginning
of our great cosmic day, only the primordial
energy
existed.
It
was
an
etheric,
spiritual
fundamental
substance
of electromagnetic
attributes
from
which,
in the
course of development,
all beings, from planets to bacteria and
human
beings,
came
into
being
through
progressive
117
condensation.
Everything
alive
came
into
being
from
this
universal fire nebula, the first materialization
of the primordial
light. It is made and formed out of the shapelessness
to which
the influences of the constellations
were, in a manner, effective
in giving direction as carriers of particular cosmic rhythms. The
infinite differences of forms and shapes and their ever-changing
"destiny"
are
based
upon
the
different
crossings
at every
junction
of the heavenly
energy lines. Every crossing
can be
ascertained
and
calculated
point
by
point,
a
task
which
astrology
which, nowadays
is in the beginning
stages
of its
immense ascent, has to fulfill.
Even a human being is a part of such condensed individual-
ized universal energy. For a particular time, the human being is
an individual
part of the entire rhythm, and contains -
within
certain limits dependent
upon the mortal form -
all the possi-
bilities and abilities of the primordial being. Should he want to
practice these attributes or learn to practice them, he must -
in
order to attain the requisite abilities -
cease to exist as an in-
dividual,
as the ancient mystics used to express
it. You must
sacrifice the small volition to find the great volition. You must
reverse the "fall into matter" (the Fall of Man), the product of
which was individualization,
and carry out the return to the Fa-
ther's
house, as it occurred in the profound parable of the lost
son. Natural death as such is not this return, because this return
is a spiritual
procedure.
God is a spirit, and those who serve
Him must serve Him in the spirit and in truth! Now bear in
mind the spiritual breath.
118
The Spiritual Breath
Not all of the entire primordial substance is condensed into visi-
ble forms. The fiery primordial energy is not found only in your
organism,
where it has taken on the state of a congealed,
rigid
condition
of the coarsest vibrations.
It is not simply dispersed
among the thousands upon thousands of beings which form and
inhabit the visible worlds; the main part of this primordial
fire,
this primordial
light, fills the entire universe and forms an im-
mense invisible treasury beyond all imagination,
the entrance of
which is open to the knowledgeable.
The guide which leads to
this treasury is the breath.
The breath is, in a manner of speaking, the umbilical cord
through
which
you are uninterruptedly
in contact
with
the
universal
spirit.
When
breathing
ceases,
then
your
limited
earthly individual
life ceases. Yes, all suffering which disturbs
your personal rhythm is inevitable (you must pay heed to it) and
connected
to the activity of breathing
with annoyances.
Fear,
envy, pain, stinginess,
hate, etc., go more or less hand in hand
with serious
breathing
disturbances,
because
they are based
upon estrangement from the universal spirit. Make contact with
Him and all disturbances
will disappear like fog below the sun.
By no means is the significance of the function of breath-
ing exhausted
with the physical, chemical intake of oxygen and
the elimination
of carbon dioxide, etc. There is also a "spiritual
oxygen," if we want to retain this term, the intake of which can
be of much greater significance to you.
Know that your total "I" does not coincide with the limits
of your body; it exists not only internally but is also external to
your body, and it is much more extensive
than the physical
body.
The
breath
is
the
external
physical
function
that
119
establishes
the connection between the two parts of your being.
It is the main cable
which,
during
your life here on earth,
connects your lower mortal "I" with the eternal, cosmic human
being. Do you want to learn how to utilize this cable to its
fullest extent?
With the living breath, a human being enters into the con-
cealed
energy,
the
electromagnetic
mother-substance
from
which not only the structure and cohesion of his physical body
is always nourished anew -
since it falls apart as soon as the
breath leaves definitely
-
but which also supplies
the prime
elements
of his fluid astral body, the mostly invisible
second
form of expression
of his soul. To truly control
your breath
means to form and control,
in accordance
with your will, the
life and destiny
of both bodies.
This true mastery
over the
breath is achieved through one's spiritual impregnation,
and the
first step towards
this goal, conscious
breathing,
has already
been practically exercised.
This, of course, is no longer the first step. The second step,
this impregnation,
is much more important.
In order to achieve this impregnation
properly,
the power
of your imagination
has to be developed to a sufficient
level, a
goal that we have striven for in the preceding
exercises.
But
what is even incomparably
more important and essential is that
the procedure
of the inner awakening
must have taken place
within you; without that, any "imagination"
is dallying in super-
ficiality and every "word" remains an echo. In other words, the
transformation
of the inner point of view, the "change
of the
lights" which is the foundation of any further ascent, must have
taken place. You yourself know best how much have you pro-
gressed on this path. You have learned how to control yourself.
120
I repeat: Have patience with yourself! You will harvest the ripe
fruit only if you know how to wait.
The Awakening
Of
The Higher
"I"
By way of suggestion,
you have already
become
partly
ac-
quainted through practice with the two main centers of the pro-
creative fire which were placed within you as the "lower light"
and the "upper light." You are acquainted
with their reciprocal
relationship
and know that the upper light can only become
stronger if the lower light is weakened.
Only when the lower
one has been
overcome
can the higher
eros illuminate
and
commence its activities as we wish and aspire.
You must also know that between these two points of en-
ergy there is a third, the astral heart center, which is just as im-
portant and which you can imagine to be in the area of the solar
plexus, not far from the physical heart. Here the psycho-electric
currents of the two main directions meet and cross, namely the
north-south,
which connects the upper light with the lower, and
the east-west,
which connects the external light with the inner.
Both directions
are at right angles to each other. If you extend
your arms horizontally
while standing with the palms of your
hands upwards and at the same time receiving the breath of the
universe, you will gain and understand
through this the sacred
ancient symbol of everything
higher and everything
perfected
pertaining to mankind -
the cross.
121
Blessed Are The Pure
In Heart
The astral heart, of which the physical
heart is but a coarse
replica,
is the location
and the organ of a highly
important
current
equilibration.
All astral procedures
reflect
directly
in
this current equilibration:
All passions such as hate, envy, etc.,
but also all emotions such as fear, sorrow, and shock call forth
severe disturbances
in this significant equilibration.
Many heart
ailments have their origin in severe sorrow and many a death
has been caused by sudden shock. Have you ever paid attention
to how constrained
and irregular
the breathing
of a spiteful
person is?
Everything
Physical
Has Its
Roots In The Soul
The more you strive towards the light, the more unconditional
and victorious
becomes
the genius within you, the more you
yourself become light; also, this vital center works with much
less waste, and these streams of light flow through with much
less restraint
and conduct the circulation
of the upper energies
better and more quietly and reflect the brilliance
of the spirit
much more purely. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God!"
Mysteries
Of The Word
The awakening
of the higher "I" is closely connected
with the
deeper being of the word and breathing.
Words do not come
into being by chance; they do not form by themselves.
Words
122
are pertinent
symbols,
intimately
connected
with whatever
is
expressed,
and not what the superficial
view understands
them
to be. This is readily understood when it comes to certain verbs
(action verbs) whose sound is a reproduction
of the activity to
be represented,
for example:
hissing,
rustle,
quiver,
thunder,
lightning, breaking, etc. These words possess the ability to con-
sciously force the picture of what is expressed upon the listener.
The more original a language is, the richer it is in such "paint-
ing" of words, where sound and content cover themselves
in a
uniquely perfect manner. The German language, judged
in ac-
cordance
with that standard,
is one of the most perfect
in the
world.
If you research this more deeply, you will find that this re-
lationship
between the word and its content can be discovered
throughout.
All human language is a succession
of these kinds
of significant
symbols of sounds. That applies to every word,
every sound and every letter.
If we take a closer look at nouns or adjectives,
we will
make the peculiar
discovery
that all of them represent
firm,
rigid, visible or tangible activities,
motions that are expressed,
reproduced
through
the perception
of the senses
which they
arouse
in us. This
also
applies
to the actual
verbs
(action
words).
To
me
the
wind
"whistles"
and
"howls,"
water
"trickles,"
thunder
"roars,"
because
wind, water and thunder
trigger within me such inner feelings which are best described
by the words "whistles,"
"howls,"
"trickles"
and "roars."
A
sensory perception
is an etheric vibration and wave length of a
particular
kind in our astral center.
As everyone
knows,
the
color "red" vibrates differently
than "violet."
The external
air-
or ether-vibration
continues
through
a certain
transmission
apparatus
in our Innermost
and forms here an inner picture
123
which I, in accordance
with the training
of my thoughts,
can
call forth anew at my discretion through an act of the will with
comparatively
easier or greater difficulties.
There exists at all
times an intimate connection between this inner picture and the
word through which we express it. We do not actually think in
pictures of the senses, but rather in word-pictures,
that is, in the
end, in letters.
Therefore,
everything
we create or produce is first created
in thought or word-pictures,
which means, in the end again, in
letters. In this manner we come inevitably to the conclusion
that
letters are energy, even though they are elementary
energies;
you must, however, possess the ability to make proper use of
the letters.
If I think of "sweet" or "tart," "quiet" or "screaming,"
then
those words already contain -
purely in the succession
of the
letters -
the sense, the meaning which is connected with them
when they are expressed.
The foundation
is the word which is
thought, the first garment, the first form and the formation of a
thing. The spoken word is the second form. The visible realiza-
tion in the external, material, physical world is the third. All the
things that are around us, if they are viewed in this manner, are
a succession of letters which have become physical and tangible
and, consequently,
words. In order to understand
this in its en-
tirety,
you must often
and thoroughly
become
mentally
ab-
sorbed
in these things
and engage
in practical
experiments.
Only in this manner will you gradually learn to comprehend
the
inner being of words and letters, which contain the liveliest life.
The entire world will appear to you in a new sense as a real and
true "Word of God."
124
The Soul Of Vowels
Examine the inner sense or meaning of the "i" vowel; analyze
the effect which it has upon your feeling (the sound rather than
the shape of the letter by which it is represented).
Look at the
group of words which the vowel "i" mainly helps to form. You
will find that it mainly expresses
individualization
and separa-
tion, as in the words: I (lch), we (wir), wicked (schlimm),
grim
(grimmig),
middle (Mitte),
will (Wille), etc. Besides
that, this
vowel also includes a fiery lambent element: fiery (hitzig), light
(Licht), lightning (Blitz). 11
[In German]
the
vowel
"e"
especially
expresses,
as a sym-
bol,
expansion,
distance,
something
stretched,
etc.12 For
exam-
ple:
Plane
(Ebene),
afar
(Fremde),
talk
(Rede),
alive,
life
(Le-
ben),
lake (See),
sea, ocean
(Meer).
This also includes
a motion
in a horizontal
direction.13
11 Since the original version of this book is in German, we will give
the reader the German version of the words with the English transla-
tion. Since the vowels in combination
with the consonants
create a
certain feeling which is depicted here as the soul of the vowels, this
feeling is not always conveyed
when the German word is translated
into English. The same feeling can be conveyed with English words,
but it will not always be the same vowel as in German. We will give
some examples, but, as in the original version of this book, it is part of
the exercise to find your own words which create these feelings. Also,
you might find it easier to find these words and the feeling connected
with them when you employ sound; in other words, not the way they
are written, but the way they are spoken. However, you will not find
the distinction
between the vowels in English. In order to determine
the spiritual level of a language, all the reader has to do is examine the
consistency of the expression of the vowels and feeling derived. - ED.
12 In English,
the vowel
"a" more clearly
occupies
this position.
- ED.
125
[In German] the vowel "O" gives you a feeling of an up-
ward motion, as you will recognize
from the following
word
groups
which this vowel helps to form. For example:
Top,
above (oben), enormous (gross), extol (loben), arrogant (stolz),
death (Tad), God (Gatt), etc.14
[In German] the vowel "u" expresses
the lower, like the
word under, underling,
etc., whereas the vowel "a" expresses
the corporeal,
the physical.
Do you now comprehend
the pro-
found significance
that the ancient, highly sacred expression
of
God's name, Jehovah, when properly written (IEOUA), contains
all five vowels?
Examine the consonants
in the same manner and you will
also find significant
secrets of the same kind concealed
there.
You will discover in the "1" an inner relationship
to the German
word Welle which [in English] means wave, which is similar to
the [English] word "bell," where the "1" has a relationship
to a
wave of sound. In the consonant
"s" there is a relationship
to
fire, etc.
It is absolutely
necessary
that you undertake
such studies
daily. Before you can work with these energies, you must have
become well acquainted
with them. How you can accomplish
this practically will be discussed later on.
13For the English-speaking
student,
this requires
words
with the vowel
"e,"
which
will
probably
symbolize
the corporeal,
such
as element,
egg, etc. - ED.
14 This
applies
partly
to English
as well;
however,
the English
vowel
"u"
also
gives
the same
feeling,
for example:
upwards,
uppermost.

The Sacred OM And
Its Practice
Let it be said that particular
relationships
exist between certain
parts of the body and certain letters, a circumstance
which can
be turned
to one's
benefit.
Every
organ, every body cavity,
every body part has, so to speak, its own resonance.

this clear in your mind with the following example: If you stand
before a piano and sing in certain clear tones towards the in-
strument, you will awaken an echo with these tones. The appro-
priate strings of the piano vibrate according to the sounds emit-
ted, some more and others less. Piercing, disharmonious
sounds
produce an echo only in so far as they contain musical tones.
A human being is but an instrument
upon which a knowl-
edgeable will is able to play, provided that it is "in tune." Are
there not human beings who are all music? And are there not
others whose whole being is one single dissonance,
who are al-
ways out of tune or disgruntled?
Your entire body is rhythm which has turned into a solid
form. It is, so to speak, "the word of God" that has turned into
flesh, which as you know from earlier discussions expresses and
reveals itself in the visible world in the form of rhythmic laws.
The solidification
of this rhythm which has become form is
in reality
only an illusion,
because
behind
it is concealed
a
lively life that reacts extensively upon all the rhythm that influ-
ences it from the outside. Every dance, every march, shows us
that the effect of music on the whole teaches us the way a per-
son feels, his mood and the well-being of human beings. Music
is nothing more than a spirit that has become audible and which
has revealed itself to the ear. Of course, this spirit wishes and
aspires to harmony in the entire sphere of its revelation.
"The
127
Music of the Spheres" which was known to the ancients exists
in reality and affects even the lowest physical worlds.
To reiterate: Every organ in the body
has its own tone out
of which it came forth, and it is structured
upon this rhythm.
Should you succeed in bringing this sound externally
to the or-
gan, then this organ will vibrate, which enables it to increased
activity, to an increased, more highly potentized performance.
The point of contact, the "seat" of the divine genius in a
human being is, as you know, approximately
at the center of the
head, in the area of the so-called pineal gland, from whence it
emanates in all directions. The object is to find the sound which
is particular
to the cranial cavity in whose focal point this cen-
ter of emanation lies, and then to make use of it systematically.
This particular
sound is recognizable
when it increases the vol-
ume of an intense resonance on the inside of the head and is to
be paid attention to. This is not always the same in every indi-
vidual and race. Here the structure of the head is of great impor-
tance. For instance, in a man of the Aryan race, this sound lies
in the neighborhood
of E on the musical scale, which you can
find approximately
in the middle of the keyboard on any piano.
It is necessary to ascertain this sound by experimentation.
More
about this later.
Sound and letter are in a close relationship
of activity,
whereby the letter gives, so to speak, the sound its organic gar-
ment, in which it can best effect its inner value. This relation-
ship is much closer,
as can be explained
in a few words.15
15 Here we are referring
to the German pronunciation
of the vowels,
such as "a," which is pronounced like the "a" in father. The vowel "e"
is pronounced
like the "e" in bed. The "i" is pronounced
like the "i" in
hit, bit, lit. The vowel "0" is pronounced
like the "O" in hot, lot. The
vowel "u" is pronounced like the "u" in bull, full. - ED.
128
Therefore
you can speak of a shrill "i" but not of a shrill "a."
You can percei ve a "u" as a deep sound, but not an "e."
Once you are developed to a certain degree, you will notice
that sound and words or parts of words, especially
vowels, are
in a peculiar relationship
to the various colors. That is the ap-
pearance of the so-called "color-hearing."
It is desirable to pay
attention to these things and to carry out appropriate
investiga-
tions on yourself.
What kind of color perceptions
do you en-
gender through the vowels "a," "e," "i," "o," "u"? What kind of
color perception
do you engender
by hearing certain kinds of
music or certain kinds of tones on the musical scale? Recognize
that sounds are also light, and that light can also be perceived as
sound. There must also be a universal consciousness
of which
sight and hearing are only human modifications!
Utilizing the sequence of letters through which the musical
note E receives its strongest resonance is the traditional,
ancient
and sacred
Sanskrit
syllable
"OM,"
which
in our course
of
instruction
will receive
its proper
fundamental
significance.
Practicing
its mode of application
systematically
and, on the
other hand, beginning and promoting the inner upheaval of the
concept
of space
and time
(since
without
it you will
not
advance)
are
the
essential
tasks
with
which
you
will
be
occupied at this level.
Practice
You have more than enough
to do in working
through
the
aforementioned
chain of thoughts;
besides
that, you have re-
ceived practical
hints in accordance
with how you are to pro-
ceed. Now carry out the following special tasks:
129
In the morning:
1. Practice spiritual awakening.
2. Practice cosmic breathing.
3. Alternating every other day, meditate on:
(a)
The symbol of the pentagram.
(b)
The symbol of the sun.
During the day:
4. Practice silence (as described).
5. Once a day, the thousand-year
practice.
6. During your main meals, practice cosmic gratitude.
Evenings:
7. Alternate daily:
(a)
30 minutes of the spiritual ABC's, or
(b)
The coffin exercise,
along with the attempted
"I
am" and the jubilation
and ecstasy.
Following
that, the "OM" practice every evening.
Explanations
(1) The "spiritual
awakening"
is symbolized by waking up
every morning, and therefore it should be practiced immediately
thereafter.
The natural
[earthly] consciousness
(not the awak-
ened consciousness)
lies in a dream-like
condition,
and is not
fully active. This exercise will contribute
to awaken it from its
slumber. Practice as follows:
Immediately
after you awaken,
enliven
yourself
through
repeated
flexing
of all your muscles.
Then relax completely
and, while you are totally mentally awake, follow the instruc-
tions given in the Third Letter concerning
the passive phase in
130
the chapter on the major concentration.
Even the head should
not be moved at all. Now entertain the thought: You have just
returned from a long voyage; you have been away many, many
years and everything
you see, you see for the first time. View
your surroundings
from your position of rest, everything
in its
smallest
detail: the wallpaper,
the furniture,
the curtains,
etc.
Do this as if you have never before seen all the things you ob-
serve. Let them affect you as if they were something completely
new. See if they do not have something
new to say to you,
something
which they have not done until now. Also, should
you be married, look upon your spouse and your children from
this point of view. Do they not have something to say to you
that you did not know or that you were not aware of? Have a
plan for every day. Once this exercise has fulfilled its purpose,
you will know it; therefore, I do not have to say anything more
about it. Duration of this exercise: several minutes.
(2) Cosmic Breathing: The moment you get out of bed, be-
gin this exercise. Duration: several minutes.
Sit upright with your hands on your knees, your back free
(in other
words,
no backrest),
in front
of an open window
through which you look to the outside. Now breathe slowly and
freely, fully controlling
your thoughts,
without any forced un-
naturalness.
While practicing
this, think and create a mind-picture
of
the following: With every breath I inhale, I am in direct contact
with the ends of the world!
The air that I inhale
continues
without interruption
around the entire earth and far into outer
space. I draw this breath into me from space, and I actively
come into contact with the remotest distances, and these most
131
remote distances
are spirit, living spirit! And out of this spirit
treasury I draw all the energies that I wish!
Should you have justified
wishes, then charge your inhala-
tion with them. Practice until you succeed and until you have a
clear feeling that you have done it properly. Never overdo this
exercise,
and also, do not over-exert
yourself. The more com-
pletely you forget your physical body, the better it will be. It
will serve this purpose best if you begin by imagining "the ends
of the world," as indicated above, then turn to the vivid mind-
picture of the "treasury of the spirit" and conclude the exercise
by adding this sentence to your wish-breathing:
"Peace and en-
ergy for the entire day," or something
that is appropriate
for
you. It is up to you to make changes in accordance with the cir-
cumstances that prevail.
3(a) Meditation
on the five-pointed
star is practiced
in the
following manner: Draw a pentagram with ink or a lead pencil
by drawing five lines of equal length in the shape of an upright
star, as shown below, approximately
2 inches (5 cm) in diame-
ter.
Now place this drawing in front of you so that you can look
at it easily. Enter into your customary state of passivity.
Begin
by focusing in on the pentagram with the following questions:
"Wherein
lies its peculiarity
and perfection?
What connection
do I myself have to the number 5?"
132
Now imagine the lines to be emanating fire, and allow them
to influence
you as lines of energy. Totally
immerse yourself
therein. Assume the position of the star externally
and seek to
feel how this star gleams within you. Say to yourself: "The star
out of the chaos!" Feel with ardor how the lines of fire pene-
trate you, how you yourself become this star. The duration
of
this exercise is not to exceed 10 minutes.
(b) Meditation
on the symbol of the sun: In the same man-
ner as 3(a), draw a circle approximately
11/2   inches (3 cm) in
diameter with a point in the center. Practice this meditation
in
the same manner as described in 3(a) by concentrating
upon the
following points: "Why is the circle more perfect or complete
than the star? What or whom does the circle represent? What or
whom does the point represent?
What happens
to the circle
when I move the point from the center of the circle to an arbi-
trary position?!"
Now imagine the circle also emanating fire. Transfer your-
self in spirit into the center and immerse yourself completely
in
it. From where you are in the center, the distance to the edge of
the circle is the same on all sides. Everywhere
around you the
fiery blaze burns.
Change   your position within the circle! What happens now
to the circle? Transfer yourself to various places within the cir-
cle! Where and how do you view the circle now? Say to your-
self: "The center
is everywhere!"
Experience
this internally.
The duration of this exercise is not to exceed 10 minutes.
(4) Practice
silence,
as described
in this Letter.
133
(5) The Thousand-Year
Exercise:
Imagine in detail what
would happen to a human being or a place in 100 years. You,
your friends,
your colleagues,
your competitors,
your spouse,
your children.
. . what has become of them in 100, 500, 1,000
years?
Look at their
mortal
remains,
which,
when they are
touched,
turn to dust. Look at them scattered
in the ground,
sand and water, at home and in foreign lands. They died sud-
denly or through lingering ailments, they died as a result of an
accident, were killed or killed in action. Every day choose a dif-
ferent person for this exercise and look at them from this point
of view.
~
Then proceed
to the localities.
The house in which you
live, the street, the part of the city you live in, the whole city,
yes, even the country you live in, what will happen to these in
100, in 500, in 1,000 years?! Look at the houses where today
you find gardens;
the gardens
where today you find houses.
Look at the cities, desolate or totally gone, turned back to the
forests which were there before the cities. You see deserts and
prairies
where once the pulse of large metropolitan
cities was
beating.
Plants and animals have found new areas where man
for a long time considered himself to be master over them. Who
took all this away? Who changed it all, and who banished it into
another form?
Form and transformation
are the only things you see. Only
the tempo changes and only your sight is limited. And you once
mourned
over these transitory
forms,
or you were proud
of
them! Your life is nothing but a raging fall to your death. What
tomfoolery and racket has this shameful insanity all around you
made out of this moment of God?
134
(6) The Cosmic Exercise of Gratitude: Whenever you have
a meal, stop for a moment and send your thoughts full of grati-
tude to the place where it grew for you. When you eat an apple,
think of the tree which blossomed for you so that you may live.
When you drink milk, think of the cattle which sacrificed
it for
you. When you break bread, think of the grain field that the sun
ripened for you. If this would not have been done for you, you
would not enjoy these things. All these foods are direct mes-
sages from the kingdom of the One who is eternally alive. Mes-
sages that say to you: Live! Live for Me! Your answer should
be enjoyment with gratitude.
Do not say: "I was the one who paid for everything!"
You
paid for it with money, but who gave it to you? Who made use
of the human mediators in order to give it to you?
Do not say: "I worked for it, therefore I deserve it. . ." Who
gave you the ability to work and who maintained
your health?
Who protected you from accidents?
Before you eat, sacrifice a thought of gratitude to the Uni-
versal Spirit.
Say very little, but eat consciously;
then every
meal will advance your inner development.
7(a)
The evening exercises are by far the most important at
this particular
level, since you take these impressions
with you
to sleep.
The spiritual ABC's are at the top. This exercise is of the
greatest significance
for the practical
awakening of the eternal
human being which slumbers
in everyone,
but who, as far as
you are concerned,
is already in the process of awakening.
It
will help to form and develop the spiritual body by means of the
energies of the letters. Only the spiritual body is able to assure
you a personally
conscious continuance
beyond physical death.
135
We have become acquainted with the energies of these letters as
elementary
symbols of motion, so to speak, as final units upon
which the multiform
of all the things around us can be traced
back. Since human beings also belong among these multifarious
forms, they learn on the basis of these indivisible
units or the
effective
energies
that are concealed
therein
to create
them-
selves anew on a new foundation. A final understanding
of one-
self is revealed
to such individuals,
a perceptible
comprehen-
sion of one's most profound character which cannot be attained
in any other manner. The procedure is as old as it is reliable.
You are by no means dealing
here with an intellectual
course of action in the common sense. What is set in motion is
over and above all intelligence;
you cannot judge this from the
point of view of the common intellect, but only on the basis of
one's own experiences,
which alone convey the proper knowl-
edge.
The entire procedure
could best be described
as a parallel
to the
breathing
procedure.
Just
as the
conscious
spiritual
breathing endows one with the highest attributes, this procedure
also becomes an invaluable weapon in the hands of the knowing
practitioner.
In the same manner, I will teach you the practice of
the letters, and to be the artist and the keyboard
at the same
time, the singer and the song in one; only then will the song
have the assurance
of eternal life and achieve the unpunished
passage through the gates of death when it enters into the mys-
tical marriage with the higher self-consciousness
of the human
being.
What is of importance
here is this: You should learn to
speak the letters in your mind and transfer the concept of your
"I" into certain parts of your body. Here you are, so to speak,
dealing with a new way of learning how to stand and walk in
136
the spirit. Now you have the foundation
for these exercises.
Therefore
begin these exercises
with your feet. Continue
from
one part of the body to the next, from organ to organ, systemati-
cally upwards. It is desirable to study the inner structure of your
entire body to the extent that you know where every organ is
located. Having this knowledge makes the exercises
easier and
expedites
them. Furthermore,
it is a law that if these energies
are properly executed and awakened in the feet, the spiritualiza-
tion process
spreads
automatically
to the other parts
of the
body. It should suffice here to point to the entrance of the path,
for anyone who practices
the exercises
properly
will find the
remainder of the path by himself or herself.
Continue
as follows:
Choose a quiet hour in the evening
when you will not be disturbed in order to practice the vitaliz-
ing of the word. Begin in the proper posture with an evocation.
Collect yourself,
close your eyes, spread your arms sideways,
your elbows
in an angle, your hands slightly
open with the
palms turned upward in a receptive gesture. Speak slowly, con-
sciously tasting every word:
"Perfect Spirit, I am calling you!
Perfect Spirit, enlighten me!
Cause what is here to be there,
And what is there to be here.
And be omnipresent to me!"
With these words the mortal within you calls the immortal.
Following
this, the actual
exercise
begins,
and you can
practice this while standing and walking slowly, or while sitting
or lying down. Choose whichever
is most successful
for you.
The most effective
way is usually
the passive
phase
of the
137
concentration
exercises;
at least
do this
in the
beginning,
because in this manner you will reach your goal much faster.
Later on, you will not be so dependent upon preparations
of this
kind. Every ability develops through exercises.
Now seek to have the letters come alive in your feet. Start
with one letter first.
It is much easier
with the help of the
breathing
exercise.
Inhale slowly and naturally,
and when you
exhale imagine that you breathe the letter into the left foot. At
the same time, seek to transfer your "I" consciousness
into the
left foot and feel the inner effect, the inner being, the spirit of
the letter in the foot; perceive it with feeling. That may seem to
be more difficult than it really is, but if you employ some per-
severance
it can be achieved.
It is very important
to develop
energy
and endurance,
as without
it you cannot
become
the
master builder of your immortal body. You must practice
and
repeat it -
even though you might not be successful
immedi-
ately -
until you clearly feel certain changes in the respective
part of the body, in this instance the foot. Only then has the
purpose
of this
exercise
been
fulfilled,
the particular
goal
achieved. It should also be mentioned that in the course of time
the physical body will experience a change, a refinement,
which
will be obvious to the onlooker.
It should also be mentioned that this whole system cannot
be accomplished
in one month,
nor in several
months
-
a
realization
to which anyone would come in due time. In order to
complete this exercise it will require years of serious, continu-
ous work and immersion in this task. The divine art of spelling
is not child's play. Whoever is offended by its peculiarities
and,
when reading the instructions,
finds them to be childish, absurd
or incomprehensible,
truly does not know what he or she is do-
ing and will soon change as soon as he or she decides to walk
138
this path,
since
all of this is based
upon ancient
experience
and
through
practice
has been proven
thousands
of times.
(b) The Coffin Exercise: Darken the room. Place a burning
candle on a shelf directly above your head. Lie down on a bed,
couch or the like. If nothing else is available,
sit on a chair.
Bring about the passivity
and engage in the following
medita-
tion:
Now you are lying in a coffin. With all your senses, famil-
iarize yourself
into this concept
as intensely
as you possiply
can. Feel how closely the walls of the coffin surround you, how
your feet touch the wood, how the lid of the coffin is closed
above you. Smell the putrefying
wreaths. Listen to the worms
eating
and moving
through
the walls of the coffin.
Awaken
within yourself a feeling of seclusion and great loneliness.
Once
you are completely
permeated by these feelings, begin the sec-
ond part of this exercise.
Your body is now your coffin. You are buried within this
body. The limbs, flesh and bones are the walls of the coffin in
which you are incarcerated.
Once you have clearly experienced
this, then continue with the third sequence of thoughts:
Are "you" identical with your body? No, you are not! Are
you bones, flesh, nerve tissue, brain or lungs? No, certainly not!
All of these are but your tools, of which you make use. Who are
you? You are a part of the universal cosmic will, of completely
equal value to every other part, eternal and indestructible
as it
is, a spirit from this spirit. Be conscious
of this truth in all its
profundity.
It is absolutely
necessary
that you do so. Speak
slowly in your mind, with special emphasis on these words: "I
am!" Jubilate them into you. Feel: "I am a creative spirit, which
does not change! The form is a created thing which may decay
139
when it has fulfilled its task!" Allow yourself to be pervaded by
the magnificence
of this thought: "Immortal Spirit! . . ."
And finally,
proceed
with an attempt to achieve
ecstasy.
Ecstasy means to be able "to stand outside, to have the ability to
place yourself outside," in other words, to step out. You have to
step out of your physical body in order to draw any conclusions
out of your knowledge.
This occurs
as follows:
Imagine
as
intensively
as you can in your mind that you rise, get up, and
slowly walk towards the door. In order to accomplish
this, it is
necessary
to imagine every single movement,
especially
when
you make your first attempts. The more you have perfected
the
passive
phase of the major concentration
and can place your
physical
body into this state, the more you will be able to
devote
your
thoughts
to the
exercise,
and
hence
you
will
succeed sooner and better. If you do not succeed right away, no
harm is done. Everything is development.
While standing at the door, look back upon your physical
body which is resting there in peace. Observe every detail of
your body, the position of your limbs, the color and expression
of your face, the detail of the furniture upon which your body is
resting and the surroundings.
Bear in mind that you are dealing
here not with a typical fantasy exercise, but with the exercise of
a well-schooled
power of the imagination.
The better your pro-
gress has been on the "path," the sooner you will succeed. This
is an action of self-objectivity
in which a great secret should
show its effects
practically,
the secret of the potential
omni-
presence of the spirit.
Bear in mind that whenever you think about another place,
it requires a certain quality of being there. You are there in your
thoughts,
and that means you are actually there with a part of
your
being,
your
entire
being.
You
are
actually
and
truly
140
transferred
there. Now you shall learn to increase this -
you
will be able to transfer with such intensity as to make actual and
objective observations
from this new point of view. The success
of this is, on one hand, dependent upon the degree to which you
can forget your physical body and, on the whole, your coarser I;
on the other hand, it depends on the level of concentration
you
have reached. Everything
that appears to you on the outside is
nothing but your inner imagination.
Repeat the above exercise until you have felt unmistakably
that you have been "outside of your body" and made objective
observations
which you can verify. Never exercise more than 30
minutes daily. If you do not achieve your goal within 30 min-
utes, then postpone it until next time. Frequent repetition
leads
to success. Should you experience
any physical or nervous dis-
comforts,
stop the exercise
immediately.
Repeat this exercise
the next time you feel at peace.
Once you have succeeded
with this fundamental
exercise,
leave your room in this state of ecstasy and go to other rooms in
the same house, where people are present that are known to you,
and try to ascertain
what these people are doing or with what
they are occupied.
Proceed with this task exactly in all its de-
tails spiritually just as you would do it physically.
Afterwards,
examine
what you have noticed
in peculiarities
and changes.
Only do exercises
which allow you to verify the results.
Ini-
tially, limit yourself to the inhabitants
of the house you live in.
Should you notice that this exercise affects you too much, then
do it only once or twice every week. Do not force anything;
everything
must develop organically.
There are also no prob-
lems if, for the time being, you omit this exercise and begin at a
later date. You can conclude this part of the 7(b) exercise with
the "I am" penetration.
141
(c) The OM exercise will form the keystone of every day.
First
determine
your tone, as mentioned
before.
Experiment
practically
by singing one note after the other, extending
each
tone. A piano or any other appropriate instrument will serve this
purpose
well. The sacred syllable OM must be sung letter by
letter in the following sequence of sounds: A - OU
- M. Every
vowel must be drawn out, and you must conclude with the M as
a humming reverberation.
The three vowels should not be sung
with a sharply accentuated
separation,
but very softly disposed
of from one to the other.
Once your tone has been found, I recommend
that, in the
beginning,
the syllable be sung framed by the sentences:
"God
is Spirit!" and "Light is God! Life!"
Follow the musical notation which is given here as an ex-
planation.
Song (very solemn)
God is Spirit, A - OU
- M, Light is God, Life!
Voice
(Portato):
God
is Spirit,
A-OU-M,
Light
is God,
Life!
,
142
As you can see, the entire exercise is arranged around a single
chord, whose serious and deep tranquility
has to be brought to
its consequence
externally
as well as internally.
This entire
small composition
should be repeated at least 12 times. In the
course of the evening you can practice this exercise without the
accompaniment
of an instrument by limiting it to the upper half,
the vocal part, which contains the essential sounds. You have to
practice in a position of complete rest, sitting upright, with your
hands on your knees, eyes closed, completely devoting yourself
to the word and sound; in a way, you must become the word and
sound yourself. If your fundamental
sound is different from the
aforementioned,
then you have to change the chord and the mu-
sical background
accordingly.
For example, the most frequent
chords, from high to low, are C, E, and G or C, F#, and A, al-
ways in medium range.
The entire exercise is elementary,
simple and easy to per-
form. The vowels a, o and u are in a very particular relationship
as far as the vibrations are concerned; they are in a very particu-
lar inner relationship
to each other which you can find and feel
if you pay very close attention to the movements of your mouth
and your entire voice apparatus
while you articulate.
Should
you not possess an instrument,
you can do without it. All you
need to do is to make the initial singing and resonance. attempts
in accordance
with your inherited musical sense of hearing and
perception.
It will surely guide you as far as you have learned to
pay attention to it to some degree.
143
SIXTH LETTER
RISE UP AND
BECOME
LIGHT
Foreword To The Sixth Letter
You must have noticed
that, in the previous
letter, you were
given certain liberties to practice a certain exercise only in part,
and to complete the remainder at a later date. These liberties are
of necessity. The time has now come where you have to become
more independent
and slowly let go of the hand that has been
guiding you, and allow your own spiritual growth the necessary
room. Without
this you will not be able to fulfill the goal of
these letters and grow. The goal of these letters is not spiritual
uniformity,
it
is
not
disability,
but
is
instead
individual
development
of the deeper powers of the soul, even though the
goal
is
altogether
mystically
established
on
the
same
foundation.
Therefore
it is a higher
level of maturity!
The
different
astrological
limitations
of each individual
determine
the
extremely
various
distribution
of
developing
spiritual
endowments,
and that has to be taken into consideration.
One
person's
strength
may
lie
more
within
such
abilities
as
clairvoyant
dreaming
or
visions,
whereas
another
person's
ability may lie more within the effectiveness
of one's
energy
over distances.
The crown of development
of the spirit is still
the unification
of the active and passive elements; however, not
everyone is born to achieve this goal in this life.
In the Sixth Letter, I will give you the main goals, includ-
ing the instructions
for the exercises that belong to it. I will cite
them in complete detail as much as possible. It will be your re-
sponsibility
to assign these exercises to the appropriate
times of
the day. It will also be left up to you to merge the new exercises
144
with some of the Fifth Letter exercises,
since the exercises
of
the Fifth Letter are by no means concluded,
as you no doubt
have experienced.
In the future, it will also be your decision
which exercises
you will do now and which you will practice
later. The exercises that have to be practiced under any circum-
stances I have marked with an asterisk.
In the future, never neglect the exercises of the Sixth Letter
and continue to work on yourself in the sense of forming your
character,
because
with these exercises
you mould your own
destiny. Do not believe that with the completion of any of these
exercises
or any sequence
of exercises
you are finished
with
them once and for all. Be constantly on guard against backslid-
ing; be an alert guard for the spirit.
Impregnated
Water
In addition to earlier instructions,
I recommend the following as
an effective
procedure
for self-influence:
Write
a particular
sentence in the form of an order in large blue or black letters on
a piece of paper and lean it agaitlst a glass that is half filled
with water. Place the glass at the edge of a table and sit in front
of it at a distance of approximately
20 inches (50 cm). The light
should fall directly upon this piece of paper. Then enter into the
passive
phase
and
immerse
yourself
completely
into
the
wording and meaning of the sentence. Once you have become
completely
one with the idea of the sentence, direct your sight
upon the glass and imagine intensely that the spirit of the order
is drawn into the water. Then stand up and charge the water
once more by taking the glass into your left hand, while you
position the fingers of your right hand above the water in order
to let the thought-current
flow into the water. Do this with a
145
sense of authority. You are performing
a spiritual impregnation
of water, and anyone who is astrally sensitive will clearly notice
the actual
change
in the water, which can be proven
by its
different taste. Thoughts are subtle things of an electromagnetic
character. . .
Once these procedures
have been completed,
drink the wa-
ter slowly with your eyes closed.
Properly understood,
our entire life is a pilgrimage
of the
lower "I" to the higher "I." Whosoever wants to change the cat-
erpillar into a butterfly must first become spiritually acquainted
with the thought of flying. Wings can grow from yearning. We
should place the following
motto above this step: "You and I
are one!"
All the exercises pertaining to this idea arrange themselves
around this sentence as the focal point. What is of the greatest
importance here is the systematic transformation
of your accus-
tomed concept of time and space, the orderly separation
from
the traditional,
and the bringing about of an extended
encom-
passing "I" consciousness.
The Centrifugal Exercise *
Immerse yourself into the following concepts, one after another:
(a) The base of a mountain
(b) An ocean wave
(c) A cloud
(d) The starry sky
146
You should feel yourself in these concepts
subjectively
rather
than objectively,
so that,
spiritually,
you become
what they
represent. Proceed as follows:
(a) The Base Of A Mountain:
Stand with your eyes closed
and your feet apart in such a manner as if you intended to an-
chor or root them into the ground. Remain motionless
and, as
intensely as possible,
imagine that you are the mountain,
your
legs being the base. Forests grow on you. You are traversed by
water veins; roaring life pulsates within you. You are one with
the earth. You are a part of it and you feel its delights
and
pains: the glowing sun, the raging storm, even every pain is a
delight, because it is life!
(b) An Ocean Wave: Proceed in accordance with the afore-
mentioned instructions.
Immerse yourself into the words "ocean
wave" and what they represent.
Take part in the surging and
billowing of an infinite flood around the globe, independent
and
free of the soil, gliding
freely
and infinitely.
Be the wave
yourself, feel yourself as the wave!
(c) A Cloud: Follow the previous instructions;
however, do
this exercise sitting down in the same position as with the con-
centration exercise. Immerse yourself by imagining that you are
floating
freely,
high above the ground,
gorges
and canyons.
Look at the earth far below as a globe. Differentiate
between
the blue oceans, the green forests, the white snow lines of the
glaciers. Look at the silvery threads of the rivers. Look above
and see the eternal sun in an inexhaustible
glow.
147
(d) The Starry Sky: This is the most difficult
exercise
in
this chapter. The best way to tackle it is in a position
of rest.
The best time is in the evening, when everything is quiet, possi-
bly on a couch or in bed, before falling asleep. Immerse your-
self in this concept: Imagine that the limits of your skin are the
limits of the firmament.
You yourself are the starry sky, with
everything
that is contained therein. Within you orbit the suns
and planets,
moons and comets. They orbit in majestic
order
and tranquility.
Just as the blood flows in your body, that is
how living currents
of energy flow through the inner cosmos.
And just as the spark of your thoughts
is present
as fast as
lightning in your arm, head or leg, so will you also be present
everywhere
you want to be in the inner cosmos. "You are eve-
rywhere you want to be."
When this exercise is properly executed,
it brings with it-
self the sentience
of perfected
secure tranquility,
which is be-
yond compare. Any burgeoning of unrest tells you that you have
made a mistake somewhere,
and that you should begin anew at
another time. The next exercise serves that purpose.
The Infinity
Exercise
In a proper position of rest, concentrate
on a bright dot or light
ray, for instance on a sun ray which falls through an opening in
a curtain or a light ray from a lamp which you have to isolate
through appropriate means. Look at it until the image is as clear
as the original. In order to produce and control this image, it is
sufficient
to suddenly look away from the object and rest your
eyes on a dark area, then change your position and call forth the
image anew, until it fades and passes over into the imagination
of infinite space. The next exercise is especially important.
148
The Higher Mirror Exercise *
Learn to observe your entire external life as a reflection of your
inner life. Everything that you encounter, everything that befalls
you or happens to you is the answer to your inner state, to the
inner readiness
which you, on your part, bring to these things.
Neither "good" nor "evil" are imposed upon you arbitrarily
by
an external moody power. You yourself, your higher "I," sends
these things to you in order to learn from them about their com-
ing. In this manner,
human beings and things are carriers
of
veiled messages which you have to understand
in order to par-
take of their blessing.
The person as such means nothing,
but
what he has to tell you means everything.
Once you understand
this and make it your inner possession,
that person will be with-
drawn from your life and disappear. Everything
you experience
is an outflow of your inner state of maturity. Even "immaturity"
belongs to the above-mentioned inner readiness -
it calls for
Divine Providence in order to come into knowledge. As soon as
you change, as soon as your outlook changes, your surroundings
take on a different
appearance.
Then, unconsciously,
you are
catling other things, and they must then cross your path.
The Fruit Of Your Thoughts
The fruit of your thoughts is one of the most important
things
about which you must be informed. Thoughts that you transmit
are energy capital that you invest. They are coined forms which
develop while alive. They are organisms to which you give in-
dependence
by sending them out so that they can work for or
against you in the causal sphere. Since they are electromagnetic
energy systems, they attract the same elements so much more to
149
the degree
that they are equipped
with thought-energy,
and
eventually,
after they have done their work, they return to you
like the Australian
boomerang
laden with either blessings
or
destruction.
This return occurs in specific numerical
intervals,
where the I year periodic,
the 7 year periodic,
and multiples
thereof are of particular importance.
Contemplate
again and again the thoughts,
intentions
or
deeds through which you have cause,d those things that you now
experience,
which at one time you sent to yourself, for they are
the reflection
which you have, so to speak, inflicted upon your-
self. Analyze the people and things which you meet in respect
to the question: Why do they reflect myself? Recognize yourself
in other people (things), albeit from a higher point of view.
This peculiar reflection
begins already with your immedi-
ate surroundings,
with people
and things
in your proximity.
Question yourself in respect to your own spouse, your friends,
acquaintances,
etc., why, especially why they have crossed your
path. Recognize
the guidance
of your external
life being con-
ducted by your own higher inner life!
Respect and pay attention to even the smallest event. Do
not believe that there are things in this world which are unim-
portant and meaningless.
Everything
is a tool, everything
is an
analogy.
When you are analyzing all these things and occurrences,
also include
the dream symbolism
with which you have now
become familiar and which is very essential. It will give you the
most important information,
because without the dream symbol-
ism you will not be able to obtain a truly thorough understand-
ing of what the intentions
are here. The keys to this are con-
cealed therein and their skilful employment must become habit.
150
To recognize thoroughly
and completely
the great unity as
an external sign, even on the smallest scale, practice the follow-
ing exercise for at least a few weeks.
Help Yourself
*
This means: Perform all the work that belongs to your daily per-
sonal maintenance
yourself. Make your own bed, clean and air
your bedroom, wash all the dishes that you have soiled. Sweep,
clean and dust. And as far as all your other (professional)
duties
allow, help with preparing
meals; peel the potatoes,
clean the
vegetables,
do the shopping.
Furthermore,
set the table, clear
the table, participate
in washing or drying the dishes. Of course
everything is to be done as is possible within the scope of your
particular personal circumstances.
You do not have to give any detailed explanations
to other
people in regards to your activities.
Limit yourself
by giving
general
answers.
You will find the words which conceal
the
more profound
nature of your activities
without being in con-
flict with the truth. The external mechanical manual work is not
of importance as far as this exercise is concerned,
but the man-
ner in which you do it is.
You have to do this with a cheerful
mood and a happy,
obliging
heart.
Practice
an especially
keen
control
of your
thoughts. Never allow any feelings of weariness,
boredom and
criticism
to cause you to abandon this exercise.
Always keep
this fact firmly in mind: that all visible things with which you
come in touch are the body of God, His perceptual
revelation,
His outer garment. If you love God, you must also love all these
things, you must love the Creator through creation.
Fill your
heart with this feeling, a feeling of sacred love, a love that does
151
not appertain to the thing as such, but to the infinite might and
cosmic
energy
that stand behind
it, a love that is above all
things.
As proof that you have completely
reached this level, and
have replaced the lower connection
with the higher, do the fol-
lowing exercise at least once at this level.
The Elimination
Exercise
*
Detach yourself from an object of which you were especially
fond at earlier levels of your development
and which was valu-
able to you, such as money or something representing
a mone-
tary value, particular
treasures,
such as works of art, jewelry,
etc. Donate the particular
object to a good, charitable
purpose.
Do this gladly, with an absolute inner renunciation.
Always re-
member that the words "all things are yours" also applies
to
you. How can he who owns everything be inseparably
bound to
a single item?
When you make this offering, do it quietly, possibly unno-
ticed. The "recording
angel," to whom nothing is hidden, sees
your most secret chamber. He sees the purity of your volition.
He is, as in everything,
also within you. Remember
the poet
Schiller's
words:
"Do not have your heart cling to goods
that adorn your life in passing.
Those who have possessions
should learn to lose,
those who are fortunate, should learn pain!"
Learn to lose, learn pain! You will be repaid a thousand
times in the inner kingdom. . .
152
When you make this sacrifice, as mentioned above, for the
benefit of someone who is in need, in the end the other person
is yourself. You make yourself a present of that which you are
giving away. In the higher sense you do not lose it, even once. It
remains in the circle of the great unity that surrounds you and
the other person. Whether the other person is just as well in-
formed as you are about these secrets of the spirit is not impor-
tant. Everything
depends
upon your course of action and the
manner by which you accomplish it.
The higher
mirror
exercise
which
is woven
like a red
thread through this whole step always directs your special atten-
tion upon the following.
The Secrets Of Names
*
You have already been informed that the name which an object
carries is under no circumstances
a "coincidence,"
but is con-
nected in the most peculiar
manner with its inner being. You
have had sufficient opportunities
to obtain, when it comes to the
vowels and the many action words (verbs), clear illustrations
of
this inner connection.
Now learn to apply this to human beings. Know that the
name which is given to a person is anything but unimportant
and indifferent
to his further development.
It is, in a manner of
speaking, the seal that is impressed upon him or her shortly af-
ter birth. It is a forming energy which accordingly
affects his or
her future nature. A name is destiny!
As a preliminary
exercise, try to understand
the names of
certain things, such as "tree,"
"soul," "abyss,"
or certain con-
cepts such as "love," "hate," "mercy," and "omnipotence"
from
the inner point of view. Make use of the hundred upon hundreds
153
of opportunities
that offer themselves
to you every day to pur-
sue such considerations,
especially
such words which, for one
reason or another,
leave you with an especially
profound
im-
pression during the course of the day. Try internally to compre-
hend them analytically,
try to understand the energies which are
active within them, try to understand
them as energies
them-
selves. Then proceed with the names of people with whom you
are somehow in contact.
The Magic Of Names
Always remember that the name of an individual
is an impres-
sion which is conferred
upon him or her shortly
after birth,
seemingly
arbitrarily.
Even the searching
and finding
of the
proper name by the parents
is in accordance
with firm inner
laws. The will of the parents is by no means as free as they
themselves
usually
assume.
However,
they should
always
be
aware that with this right of giving their children names, they
exercise a destiny-determining
might, and the responsibility
of
this act is not minute. Although they are only the mediators of a
higher will, even mediators
are obligated
to act in accordance
with their knowledge and conscience if they do not want to vio-
late their duties.
The proper name is like a well-fitting
garment that fits and
suits the wearer better the longer he wears it. A human being
grows, so to speak, into his name, and blessed is he who under-
stands the deeper sense of his name and makes it his own.
It was of profound significance
when, in ancient times, the
victor who had conquered
a powerful enemy took his name as
well as his weapons. It is, in fact, of absolute importance
that
the last descendant
of a dying family transfer
his name to an
154
adopted child in order to preserve the name.16 It is often the cus-
tom in North
America
to include,
in addition
to other
first
names, the name of some well-known person such as Washing-
ton, Luther, etc. The child receives through this a developmen-
tal tendency which he would not otherwise possess. Many peo-
ple who immigrated
to Germany
gave their children
ancient
German names such as Siegfried,
Sigurd,
Sigrid, etc. This is
definitely not a meaningless pastime, as assumed by many, but a
deliberate
attempt, unknown to most, to attract the secret ener-
gies of names for assimilation
and conquest.
It is no coinci-
dence that such names are preferred
which contain the auspi-
cious syllable "Sieg," which means victory.
A name is not "sound and fury" if you understand
it in this
sense and consider its deep roots with the nucleus of the human
character.
It is therefore
absolutely
meaningful
when, at a cer-
tain point in their development,
human beings who undergo a
particular
astral training adopt a particular
name which appro-
priately
indicates
their future activities
and which is intended
for use in an inner circle of developed brothers that are at the
same level. Even you, my student and friend, should take such a
name at the end of this course of instruction.
Deliberate now by
what name you wish to be known after the conclusion
of the
seventh step.
After you have this well thought out, direct your attention,
as has been mentioned
before, upon those human beings with
whom you are connected.
Observe
them externally
and then
internally.
What kind of symbols
appear
in connection
with
them on your horizon? Particular
groups of people? Animals?
Particular
repetitions,
orders,
warnings?
Why
are
they
16By so doing, he maintains more than just a name. - ED.
155
represented
by these particular
kinds of symbols? What should
they tell you?
The macrocosm
has something to say to you. It speaks to
you in this manner and it speaks particularly
insistently,
other-
wise it would not, and of this you can rest assured,
send you
these names.
It is also a good exercise to find out the common character-
istics of the people with whom you share the same first name.
Examine, for instance, all the people you know with the name
Henry, John, George, etc., and what they have in common. Be
assured that these common characteristics
do exist. The same
seal also determines
the same developmental
tendencies.
Hone
your psychological
sight and you will find them. These common
characteristics
are often not only of the internal
or charac-
terological
kind, but also clearly express themselves
externally
in the behavior,
facial features
and attitude
of the person
in
question.
Perfect
And Imperfect
Names
Furthermore,
examine the individual
names in respect to their
perfection;
the perfection
in essence depends upon the vowels.
A truly perfect name should contain
all five vowels,
even if
they are contained in both the first name and the surname. The
more a name meets these ideals, the more perfect it is; of course
these names are very uncommon. The bearer of such a name has
the greatest qualifications
to ascend, all by himself, to a high
degree of inner perfection
without any particular
participation
from other people. As a rule you will find in him a high degree
of emotional harmony and an inner-resting
happiness, or at least
156
you will find within him the beginning signs of or disposition
to
this inner harmony.
However, the more a name lacks any of these five vowels,
the more the person requires
the help of others, a completion
through other people, for his or her development.
And the bless-
ing of this cooperative
effort is again dependent
upon the de-
gree of reciprocal
complementation
of the names. If your name
only contains the vowels e and i, the vowels a, o and u must be
supplied in order to complement
this name. Should this not be
the case, and you only receive an a, o or u, or two of these vow-
els, then the complementation
is not complete
and you will
therefore
not achieve perfection,
or you will reach perfection
only under very difficult circumstances.
This is one of the great laws. Examine it: apply it by ques-
tioning it in regards to your marriage, your friendships,
relatives
and other relationships
such as business, etc. You will make the
most peculiar and surprising discoveries.
Do not be discouraged
by the peculiarity
and unusualness of this procedure.
In the beginning,
most of the profoundest
truths are pecu-
liar to human beings. You can in this manner and without much
difficulty
attain
unexpected,
appropriate
insight
into the for-
tunes or misfortunes
of marriages,
the harmony or disharmony
among friends. From a new point of view that will not deceive
you, you can evaluate
your professional
connections
and the
relationship
with your fellow
workers.
At times you will see
that a missing vowel is provided by the birth of child, which is
instinctively
perceived
as a necessity and added by the parents
to the child's
name. And this child then holds together a mar-
riage which was on the verge of breaking up and mends it anew.
But you will also find the opposite:
If a woman has the
same vowels as the man, which are already
contained
in his
157
name, then the marriage will very rarely last. The same polarity
will repel. The same applies to all the other closer relationships
among human beings. Observe therefore the conditions
and cir-
cumstances
of professional,
political
and other cooperative
ef-
forts or collaborations.
Also examine the reciprocal connections
between the different countries. Maybe you will reach the con-
clusion that Europe (= Europa)
is an inseparable
unity which
cannot be harmed without punishment.
Perhaps you will realize
that it is an organism
which is placed under the sign of the
cross, of which Germany (Deutschland,
pronounced
"Doitsch-
land")
is just as much an indispensable
member as any other
country.
Therefore
let me reiterate: Every human being is a unique
incarnation
of the heavenly
word and can find his own cause
and become conscious of himself by immersing himself into his
inner self and viewing the many thousands of images of the ex-
ternal world as what they are and what they want to be: reflec-
tions (mirages),
reflexes
of internal
circumstances
and proce-
dures, a world of pictures
with which you are confronted
and
with which you can compare things for the sole purpose of be-
coming cognizant,
especially
cognizant of yourself. An ancient
Indian proverb says: "The universe exists only for the sake of
your soul." This must be properly understood.
The Destiny Of The Departed
As soon as you have reached the highest level of cognizance
in
your present
incarnation,
the entire
illusionary
surroundings
around
you disappear,
the flow of pictures
by means
of the
senses ceases, the illusionary
day that surrounds
you becomes
extinguished,
and you are left alone with the quintessence
of
158
your life. If you have taken the phantasmagoria
of the abundant
external formations as genuine, and you have not recognized the
illusion in the existence, and you have taken the picture only as
a symbol,
but did not grasp the meaning,
then you are not
mature enough for the great awakening which stands at the end
of the development
of the realm of human possibilities.
You
remain more or less an obedient student who is being sent to the
same class again and again until he has understood
that the
things which pursue him, that frighten him or make him happy,
always in accordance
with the seeds he has sown, are pictures.
They are pictures
with which his unawakened
soul surrounds
herself until the time has come when the soul incarnates again.
Only
while
you are here,
in other
words
during
your
physical
life, can you awaken
out of the illusionary
dream
which is called the "world."
The longer you remain here, the
more the great reflection
(mirage) will leave you, and you will
learn to see consistently,
with greater clarity, from countenance
to countenance.
For you, the moment of death is nothing more
than
an easy
passing
over
from
a cloudy
sphere
into
the
kingdom
of complete
harmony,
just
as all the ocean
storms
affect
only the upper surface
levels of the water, but never
reach the blissful quiet depths. Whosoever has developed
these
depths within himself, whose consciousness
has descended,
or
rather ascended,
to these depths, has outgrown
all sufferings
and all transitoriness;
he has become pure spirit and entered
into the kingdom of abundance because he is the All and the All
is within him. . .
Therefore,
my friend, take account of how close you have
come to this exalted goal. Are you reconciled with your destiny,
completely
and honestly? Have you recognized
its sense? How
far
have
you developed
the
"eternal
human
being"
within
159
yourself,
whose
seat is never
the sophistic
intellect
but the
depth of the heart?
The Heart-God Devotion *
You have already noticed earlier the importance of the center of
your astral heart for the lasting connection
with the outer spirit.
By now you have understood
that this outer spirit has created
for himself other centers in which he symbolically
reflects him-
self, centers that are many thousands
of times more powerful
than your little human heart. Above all, the center
which is
closest to us is the sun. Just as the beat of your heart drives the
vital currents through your body and keeps the physical revela-
tion process going, the sun is also a point of cosmic concentra-
tion whose will drives tremendous
electric
currents
of energy
through the planetary spheres. The sun is the heart of a celestial
body which has a beat and rhythm as your own, a body in which
the planets with all their micro-organisms
are incorporated,
just
like the limbs and organs in your body. And let us say it again:
your heart is the turnover or cardinal point, and through its me-
diation this heavenly center keeps you continuously
alive. When
it sets at night, you fall asleep and enter into the dominion
of
the moon and other constellations
which, during the day, are
drowned out by the superior influence of the sun.
All of this applies only to your mortal physical body. Once
its time has expired, when the built-in clockwork
has run out,
the physical
body decomposes
and helps to form new organ-
isms. You, however, have begun to form a new immortal body
for whom the sun does not set. You have ignited within yourself
the higher consciousness
to which even the night can do no
harm. You strive towards
the inner, omnipresent,
cosmic sun
160
which shines behind and above all the physical suns, the "sun"
for which the sun on our firmament is no more than a symbol.
But as you know, symbols have a deeper significance.
They
are to be our illuminating
fires of far-away native shores. In the
spiritual
kingdom, we are to find our way back to them, from
which we became so severely estranged
through the "fall into
matter." Let the sun be an image to you, a symbol of the sacred
heart of God which offers itself day after day as a sacrifice so
that we can live, a sun that dispenses currents of fire upon the
worlds, so that what we sow may mature and our hearts con-
tinue to beat until they are demanded from us at the time of the
Great Harvest.
And they also have another reason, these great and high
symbols of the cosmos. While we spiritually connect with them,
as we say, we revere
and honor these high celestial
powers
within ourselves, those which formed us, those which united for
our formation
and maintained
our energy. Yes, and even more
than that, through this connection
we draw down to ourselves
the energies which they represent, and cause them to unite with
us to a greater extent. The ancient axiom: "What is above is
also that which is below" experiences
here its practical
effect
and application.
The thought
which we direct
towards
these
spiritual regions is the cable that connects us with these higher
powers
and makes us inseparable
and forces
its awakening,
cleansing and exalting currents upon us.
Implementation:
Face the rising sun and do the following
in sequence.
161
Appellation, Sun-Breathing
And Sun Meditation
Appellation:
After you have composed
yourself,
stretch
your
arms to the side, whereby you may imagine that you emulate
with this gesture the world-encompassing
posture
of the sun.
Then speak words such as these, slowly and fervently:
"Ignite me, fiery heart of God,
Find me, glowing fire of God,
As you rise above the universe, so rise in me.
Heal me, my Savior, of that which is mortal,
Hold me, my Holy One, in your light.
Shine eternallove
into my heart."
While in the same position, but with your eyes closed and
only if you feel the urge, continue with the following exercise:
The Sun-Breathing
Exercise: Face the sun in such a manner
that it shines directly in a straight line onto your face, possibly
directly into your mouth, which should be slightly open. Inhale
long slow breaths of the sun's energy. Imagine with the greatest
of liveliness
that you now unite with this exalted
soul of the
sun, and that you draw this soul down to you and draw her into
you. Let this imagination become totally plastic, so to speak, so
that you can touch it. Understand that the sun's energy becomes
a part of you, the sun's soul flows through the respiratory
ducts
into the center of your heart, awakens it, anneals it thoroughly
and from there spreads
throughout
the entire body. Feel the
trickling,
the rushing,
even up to the finger tips; everywhere,
even the smallest cell of your body takes part in this pervading
flow . You will learn
to know very particular, peculiar and bliss-
162
ful feelings. It is at the same time an inductive current which is
awakened
within you in this manner. Yes, it is even far more
than that -
these are spiritual energies which come forth within
you through this contact exercise. All of this you must learn to
comprehend internally if it is to come to its full effectiveness.
Once you have progressed and if you have done your exer-
cises properly, you no longer require the sun visibly in order to
reach your goal. Remember
that any daylight,
no matter how
much it is dispersed, originates from the sun, whether the sun is
visible to your eyes or not. Now begin with the Sun Meditation.
The Sun Meditation:
Take up your usual meditation
pos-
ture. Bring about the appropriate
concentration.
If you want to
bring about the desired state more perfectly, you can place some
cotton into your ears and immerse yourself into the idea: "The
heart of the sun is within me!"
Produce
the following
picture
within you, namely
a sun
center that is located in the region of the heart around which the
energies of your organism revolve.
Look at this center as a wheel, as a fiery swastika l7 which
is in a state of continuous rotating motion
and  which is permanently  connected
through  a fine
cord, similar
to an umbilical
cord, with  the  sun center that is located
outside
of you.
Meditate
on the sentence
"Heart
of the World."
Experience
how
your
consciousness
shifts
more
and
more
from
the
narrow
"I"
to the
spacious
"I," how
the
borders
of your
being
expand
17 Make
certain
that the swastika
turns
to the right,
called
Theonium:
"coming
into being."

cosmically,
and finally you will feel within yourself the beating
and pulsating celestial sun.
You will succeed with this exercise differently
on different
days. In accordance
with the degree of your ability to concen-
trate, you will sooner or later reach your goal for the first time.
However,
you have to practice this exercise only in the morn-
ing; you cannot practice it in the afternoon. You cannot circum-
vent this exercise. Always remember that as far as you are con-
cerned, if the sun is never to set for you, then you must ignite
the sun within yourself. This is an allegory, but it is more than
an allegory.
Spiritual
Travel
The light shines
without
restraint
through
seemingly
infinite
realms to our earthly sight. And the more you become light, the
more you realize that space is not what it seemed to be for such
a long time, but instead it is only a symbol of what is behind it,
which is important to comprehend.
You realize more and more
that the borders of a room no longer apply to you the moment
you no longer acknowledge
them, that they actually disappear
when you want them to. If you became light, if you created your
light body, all the royal kingdoms of the heavenly Father would
be open to you and you could travel through them in accordance
with your desires, whether these royal kingdoms be spatial or of
thought; yes, thinking is also a creation in space-forms.
Continue with your exercises in regards to spiritual travel.
Make use of the technique
which was explained
in the Fifth
Letter and progress
step by step. Once you have achieved
the
state
of concentration,
focus
in on your
goal,
practice
the
imagination
exercise
and let the vacuum of the silent waiting
164
follow. Select as an object of your exercise a human being and
objects from your immediate and distant surroundings,
from the
circle of your acquaintances
and your professional
life, from
your own hometown or from far-away places. A pictorial repre-
sentation, perhaps a photograph,
etc., of a particular person will
serve this purpose especially well. Place it in front of you at the
beginning of the exercise or bring it into contact with your solar
plexus. A small object which the individual
has carried on his
person will do. But you are by no means dependent
upon all
these things.
The best time for such attempts is at night, after sunset,
especially the hours around midnight.
The question you might ask in regards to the other person
should be formed precisely and exactly, so that there can be no
doubt in regards to the sense of the question.
Should you not be dealing with a person upon whom you
wish to concentrate,
but if the subject of your interest is not an
actual person, you will be well advised to envision the question
in large fiery letters on a black velvety background.
Beware of all unnecessary
questions. Beware of any harm-
ful thoughts which you could send to others on this occasion.
Remember that the concentration
imparts an extraordinarily
in-
creased efficacy to everything
you think. As soon as you enter
into this heightened
state, you take on a very great responsibil-
ity. With the first harmful thought you let pass, you leave the
brotherly
chain
and draw the merciless
reprisal
of the "re-
cording
angel"
upon
yourself.
Should
you
not
feel
strong
enough
or mature enough to act accordingly
at this point, then
refrain from these exercises in their entirety.
165
In any case, you would be well advised to begin these exer-
cises with an introductory
concentration
upon these words: "My
heart is full of love for all human beings!"
The Cosmic
Question
*
As soon as you have penetrated into the practice of these proce-
dures to a certain degree, you will make the observation
that
you no longer require such cumbersome preparations
as you did
in the beginning in order to bring about the state of concentra-
tion. Eventually
you will be able,
in accordance
with your
wishes, to bring this about even amidst many people, such as in
restaurants,
meetings, etc.
The Father hears the son wherever
he may be, and gives
him an answer that he has asked for in his heart. He speaks to
all human beings and answers their thousands of anxious, bitter
and humble questions -
but most of them have not learned to
pay attention
to His words and to understand
His language.
Mostly they do not even know "who" and "what" they actually
are themselves.
They have given up their royal birthright
for a
pottage of lentils, a so-called "enlightenment."
Now you have advanced to a certain point and have gained
a certain experience,
which means that you have developed
so
far as to gain the ability to associate and speak to your higher
self at any time without preparation.
If you require an answer in
a serious matter, ask without fear, ask with assurance
that you
may receive
an appropriate
response.
Exercise
your highest
birthright
and wait; be assured that you will receive an answer.
It will come to you in the form of a symbol, a person, an animal,
a situation, an expression,
a lightning-fast
inner enlightenment,
etc. It is always entirely clear and easy to understand,
provided
166
of course that you have familiarized
yourself
with the expres-
sions of this cosmic language.
You will never fail, never be misguided,
when you place
your entire outer life under the guidance of such a higher will
that speaks to you, which is none other, if you understand
this
properly, than your own will.
Belief As Potency
Of The Will
The
spiritual
mechanism
of this question
and answer
game
works much more easily and more promptly the more ardently
you are convinced
of and pervaded with its constant prepared-
ness. The answer which you receive, of course, will be entirely
different than you expected;
it will occur even in the instance
where it is not believed; it will occur with the infallibility
of a
divine law of nature. Belief is the highest and finest form of the
human will; it levels the inflowing current of the cosmic ener-
gies of answers, so to speak, into a path. Whosoever believes in
the right things and in goodness
wants to have these higher
cosmic powers, this higher will, in his deepest Innermost. Who-
soever does not believe in this does not want this, perhaps he
even deceives
himself with all kinds of sophisms in regards to
the actual
motive
of his non-belief.
Today
many people
no
longer believe in themselves,
at least not in the sense as it is
mentioned
here, because they have not yet found themselves
or
have been defeated by the deception
of the forces of destruc-
tion, who have told the searching
masses tall tales, believing
and proving with a tedious superficial
science that a human be-
ing is "only an animal," and therefore it is unnecessary
to enter-
tain and satisfy any needs which reach above that. The people
167
of the nations of the world have been subjected to this rhetoric
until they finally believe it, and they have become easily guided
objects of self-motivated
politics.
Only an awakened human being, that is, only one who has
understood
himself to be the embodiment
of the heavenly word
is actually the one capable of true belief in the highest and most
sacred sense. Nobody can see the light who has not developed it
within himself. And nobody can imagine it who has not been
called. In the period in which we now live, many are called. . .
The Pilgrimage
*
The high creative light, which has solidified into visible forms,
is beginning
its pilgrimage
around the terrestrial
sphere, in or-
der to gather, in a chain of dreams which is also called life, in-
dividual experiences
and to fulfill individual
tasks. As soon as
the dreamer awakens and realizes the deception, thus begins his
return to God. From this moment on, all form is only a mere
illusion to him and can no longer captivate him. And as the sun
travels
and shines above "good"
and "evil,"
so you too, my
friend,
travel
when
you
have
attained
the
knowledge
and
changed
your surroundings
and your garment, as a symbol of
your indestructible
self which remains the same in any kind of
form. The pilgrimage
of your life will result in a visible alle-
gory.
Implementation:
Dress in the most unattractive
clothes you
possess and engage in an activity which, if possible, is different
than your own. If you work in an office or intellectually,
then
find work either through an acquaintance
in your town or any-
where else, and let that work be heavy farm labor, garden work,
construction
work, etc., that does not suit your abilities. Should
168
you have no other possibilities,
then take time for it during your
holidays or any other free time you might have, as long as this
work is not part of any other duties you might have.
During this time span, it would be very desirable
if you
were to come into contact with people of other professions
and
settle completely
into their surroundings.
Remain silent in re-
spect to your deeper motives. Take part in their worries, wishes
and inclinations.
Do this reservedly
with the thought: God also
made these human beings, so that they can work and live their
lives; they are just as valuable parts of God's body as you your-
self.
You have a free hand as to the closer formation of this pil-
grimage;
you can adapt it in accordance
with your circum-
stances. Trade, farming, factory work will give you many possi-
bilities, and you can easily find this out.
It would
also be greatly
advantageous
for your
higher
purposes
if you could find an opportunity
and make yourself
available
to your
"enemies"
-
those
who envy
you,
your
competitors
-
and be of some kind of service
to them.
A
pilgrimage
is much more a pilgrimage the more you voluntarily
place a burden upon yourself.
Be conscious
that the smallest
activities you undertake have their mystical significance,
which
the world does not see. Allow your eyes to open up to this kind
of
experience.
Your
Father's
house
is
full
of
surprising
miracles.
This exercise is not complete as long as you feel a shadow
of antipathy
within you. Whatever that feeling is to which you
are unaccustomed,
whether it be exertion or a strange Circle of
people, it is not transformed
into light and has not been melted
with purification,
or, using ancient terminology,
"God's Love."
Only when you have fully surrendered yourself, when you have
169
experienced
the swelling joyousness,
the inner jubilation
within
you which cannot be mistaken for any other feeling, only then
has the goal of this exercise been reached,
and you can strive
towards the next step.
Close your day, the end of the day, alone or together with
others, with the following recitative:
The Candle Psalm *
I am a flame that shines eternally,
I am a breeze that never scatters,
I am the light that existed from the beginning.
Holy, holy, holy is My name.
I am the voice in the great stillness,
I am the question and I am the answer,
I am the spirit Who will live eternally.
Holy, holy, holy is My name.
I am the love and the all-merciful,
I am the lightning that unites heaven and earth,
I am the immovable, the uncreated.
Holy, holy, holy is My name!
Implementation:
When you perform the recitative,
a white
candle should be lit.
The words in bold letters should be sung in a festive, sol-
emn tone, with the same tone as the A in the OM exercise (the
Fifth Letter). Both of these words must reverberate
in their en-
tirety.
170
The remainder
of each verse must be uttered slowly in a
calm pathos.
The following
words are spoken:
"a flame that
shines eternally,"
"a breeze that never scatters,"
etc. Also the
words at the end of each verse "Holy, holy," etc.
Should you a have a piano available
or any other instru-
ment, then the words should be accompanied
by the appropriate
chord, as for instance
with the introductory
chord of the OM
exercise of the Fifth Letter. Also, the final sanctification
can be
accompanied
by the appropriate chord, just like at the end of the
OM exercises.
SEVENTH
LETTER
RISE UP AND
BECOME
LIGHT
The Double Countenance
Of Human Beings
Recognize, O human being, the profound analogy of your body.
There is no limb, no part of your body which does not have
something of its own to say to you, something in particular.
You
are a boundary being, a being between two worlds, and if you
view yourself from this point of view, you will realize that you
are put together out of two halves which express very clearly
their double origin and double determination.
Did it ever reach
your consciousness
that you have an upper and a lower face?
That the middle section of your body lies approximately
at the
height
of your
navel,
and
signifies
a section
between
two
worlds?
The lower face encompasses
all the organs and parts of the
body which occupy themselves
with the elimination
of waste
171
and with animal
procreation.
The lower
face has a nose,
a
mouth, lips, cheeks, yes, even eyes (the reproductive
glands).
You will find, if you examine it carefully,
surprisingly
exact
analogies between the upper and the lower organs and also be-
tween their manner of activity. The analogies extend so far that
conclusions
from the lower to the upper are allowed in regards
to many details and individual peculiarities
and vice versa.
The lower face is your earthly face; it is the earth and it is
turned towards the lower pole and its functions serve the lower;
the lower mouth eliminates
the waste which no longer serves
you,
but
serves
the
earth.
The
lower
nose
serves
sexual
stimulus, which weakens you but which serves the existence
of
your race. The lower nasal cavity of the woman has become the
birth canal through which the mature fruit is ejected. The lower
eyes are blind as long as they do not gain their sight from the
spark from above. The entire lower face is the distorted grimace
of the upper face, your heavenly face. It is the symbol of the
animal to which you are chained bodily as long as you live. At
the same time you have been grown together out of two bodies,
of which the lower one signifies
your corporeal
origin
as a
picture,
and the upper one signifies
your spiritual
path. Our
human ancestors became cosmic beings when they accepted the
upright
gait as a permanent
possession.
They stretched
their
heads upwards into the free air and saw the skies and the stars,
and the skies and stars became theirs. The spirit of the universe
overshadowed
them and ignited a light in their Innermost and it
became
master of the animalistic
companion
and enabled
the
blessed to be immortal. They found speech, they found singing
and devotion. For many thousands of years they were ashamed
of their
lower
brother
with
whom
they
were joined;
they
struggled with him to no end and hid him shamefully
from the
172
light of the day, until finally the hour had come when he was to
be delivered
through the "love from above." He was delivered
to serve. And behold, today this hour has come.
The Analogy
Of The Limbs
Examine
the analogy of your limbs. If the heart is the sun of
your body, then the limbs are the symbols of the six main plane-
tary energies that form your organism, including the moon. The
whole, the holy number, is seven, which became flesh and ruled
your life.
Stand upright with your feet apart and your arms stretched
upwards to the side. In your imagination:
(a)draw
a straight line between your hands and from each
hand a straight line to the sexual pole, then
(b) a straight line between your feet, and then
(c) a straight line from each foot to the head.
The result will be that you have two triangles that penetrate
each other, one with the apex downward
and the other with
apex upward.
These two triangles
form the creative
sigillum
which
has since
ancient
times
been
called
Solomon's
seal.
(Solomon's
or Salomon's
seal has nothing
whatsoever
to do
with the person of Solomon; it is a threefold expression
of three
languages
for the sun, Sol - om - on, namely sol (Latin), om
(Sanskrit), and on (Chaldean).)
The first
triangle
strives
towards
the earth,
the second
upwards
towards
heaven.
And this also contains
a profound
analogy. You are created out of the "lower" and the "upper," or
"below"
and "above,"
out of struggle and conflict,
action and
173
reaction,
two
energies
which,
so
to
speak,
penetrate
and
intersect you. Heaven and earth embraced each other in order to
call you into existence, O human being.
Symbolism Of Feet And Hands
Now address
these things in detail.
Observe
your feet: they
firmly cling to the ground and firmly keep you on the ground.
The toes are turned downward to the earth; the inner half of the
soles of your feet are traversed
by starry, orderly
lines. You
walk on stars without being aware of it, as if the cosmos which
arches below the earth immeasurably
has thrown its reflected
splendor upon you, as if the cosmos from whose lap you came
forth has sealed you with his mark.
Now look at your hands. As awkward as your toes are, that
is how finely structured
your hands are. You have ten fingers
and ten planetary energies -
including the sun, the moon and
the earth, which determine
and influence
your life. The toes,
undeveloped
as they
are, belong
to the
animalistic
partner
within you and the fingers with their fine structure give expres-
sion to your spiritual part. Each hand represents
all nine princi-
pal energies of our solar system and you yourself are adding the
tenth energy to the nine, namely the earth-energy.
The currents,
the influences
of these energies,
flow continuously
over into
you and through you; continuously
they charge you with mani-
fold graduated electric energies. Where do your thoughts origi-
nate? It is your responsibility
to guard them, to order them so
that the will of the universal
spirit,
the One who sent the
thoughts
to you, is properly
served. Did you not become one
with this, your higher will?
174
As you know, thoughts are the inner expression
of electri-
cal current fluctuations
of the universal
will. To become one
with this universal
will means to become
an active user and
controller from a passive medium of these energies; it means no
longer to be at its mercy, but instead, by assimilating
with the
Master of the universe, to become a master yourself.
The universe is external and internal. If you influence your
Inner, your influence
is effective
on the outside
all by itself,
because everything is in the most intimate contact, the most in-
timate reciprocal
action. "So God created man in His own im-
age" points to the same fundamental truth, which therefore must
be reiterated
so seriously
and urgently:
"In the image of God
created he him. . ."
Mysticism
Of The White Light
If you reflect a sunbeam through a prism, it disperses
into the
seven main colors of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo and violet. All other shades are mixtures and com-
binations of these fundamental
colors. You can imagine the fis-
sion of the divine white primordial
energy into the seven main
planetary energies in this same manner. It is not a coincidence,
but has a profound foundation,
that every planet has had a par-
ticular color bestowed upon it as a symbol.
Now pay special attention
to the following:
Animals
and
plants do not contain
all the colors of the spectrum,
but only
certain colors, which means energies. Only human beings have
all the colors united within them, at least in accordance
with
one's aptitude. It is given to human beings, by taking the proper
path
and by living
an appropriate
lifestyle,
to develop
the
radiating
white
light
within
oneself
and
consequently
to
175
consciously
find the way back to the exalted unity, and hence
out of the colorful multitude of shape, forms and personalities.
However, you must comprehend the significance
of this.
The Candelabrum
With
Seven Branches
You know the beautiful
symbol of the candelabrum
with the
seven branches,
illuminated
by seven candles, that adorns our
festive days. Know that this holy symbol originated
from an-
cient temple wisdom which was passed on to our present day
and, today as well as then, has its profoundest justification.
You
yourself
are and should be this candelabrum
with the seven
branches, upon which the energies of the Universal One glow in
seven beams, until you succeed in uniting them again with the
one Light above all lights, and time and the world will disap-
pear for you as a dream. . .
And just as the two visible ends of the spectrum have an
invisible continuation
to the naked eye -
the infrared and the
ultraviolet
light -
so the planetary
energy symphony
is per-
fected
and completed
through
the lately
discovered
planets,
Uranus and Neptune, and has increased to nine. You recognize
the holy Nine as the completion of the Seven.
The Old And New Aristocracy
You will find a peculiar reflection of these mysteries of the an-
cient past on insignias,
emblems or coats of arms of nobility,
the so-called crowns of nobility. You know that the lower aris-
tocracy had crowns with five pearls, the barons had crowns with
seven
pearls,
and counts
had crowns
with nine
pearls.
The
176
pearls are fastened on a circlet (coronet) which is placed onto
the head. Today these have become meaningless
baubles;
the
people who own these crowns are no longer aware of their an-
cient secret significance.
The golden circlet upon which the pearls are fastened sym-
bolizes divine omnipotence,
as it is incorporated
in the sun. The
pearls are the planets that revolve around the sun. Five planets
correspond
also with the thought that is reflected
in the penta-
gram. Whosoever
controls
the ancient
well-known
planetary
energies (Jupiter =wisdom and goodness, Mars =desire, Venus
= love, Mercury = intellect,
Saturn = selfishness)
has attained
the right to wear the first simple crown with the five pearls.
When Uranus and Neptune are added, a higher sense of reason
and a higher
level of love is added. Whoever
masters
these
seven, has overcome them internally and made them his own, is
not far from the uniting nine; whereas the moon symbolically
represents the temporary (transitory)
and the sun the higher (ev-
erlasting)
self of a human being. It is truly a divine thing to
honor the seven and the nine.
The ancient crowns have become meaningless;
they had to
fall, because the actual significance
was lost. Should the time
not be close wherein a new aristocracy,
an aristocracy
of the
spirit, forges itself new crowns out of the old gold?! . . . If you
want these thoughts to be practically
expressed
and have their
blessing come to live within you, then practice the letter medi-
tation.
I Am The A And The O *
We must keep in mind that the letter forms A and O, as they
have been passed on to us, conceal a profound
meaning;
they
177
are not arbitrarily
selected
kinds
of expressions
for certain
sounds, but more than that. They are gestures which, not with-
out reason, are at the beginning and end of the Greek alphabet.
They are corporeal signs and you have to learn their proper use.
Stretch your arms obliquely in front of you so that they form a
large A with its vertex lying within your torso or directly
be-
hind it. Lift your arms upwards and interlock your fingers as in
a prayer and they form the letter O.
Then proceed
with the meditation
as follows:
In a quiet
hour, take seven white candles. Darken the room, arrange the
candles side by side in one row, four to six inches apart, and
then light them. Should
you have the candelabrum
with the
seven branches,
use it. Proceed with slow and devotional
ges-
tures.
Say the following
in a solemn
and composed
manner
when you light the first candle:
"Solidified
into a form from the fire-mist,
the eternal
flame
shines
in me. . ."
When
lighting
the second
candle:
"Cast off and slain in thousands
of forms,
I awakened,
I, myself
to myself!"
When lighting the third candle:
"I traveled far. . ."
When
lighting
the fourth
candle:
"Home
is near. . ."
When lighting the fifth candle:
"My heart, jubilate.
. ."
178
When lighting
the sixth candle:
"Crown
your gates.
. ."
When lighting the seventh candle:
"Breathe immortality, take your crown!
Rejoice! Rejoice! O soul!"
Now distance yourself by a few steps from the lit candles,
lower your arms, internally assume the usual meditation posture
and strongly imagine that you are a pillar of white light. Once
the picture becomes plastic, then sing, solemnly and subdued in
the manner described earlier, the words:
"I am. . ."
Now form with your arms the letter A as aforementioned,
and
continue in the same tone:
"The multitude.
. ."
When you perform this exercise,
imagine that an infinite
abundance
of worlds and formations
emanates from you. Be at
the same time the sun which sends out currents of light and en-
ergy and produces life a thousandfold.
Relish this thought, let it
become alive within you! You yourself
are in all those thou-
sands of forms or shapes! Then form the O as aforementioned,
closing your arms by raising them above your head in the form
of a ring by interlocking
your fingers, as if you were praying,
and continue to sing:
179
"I am the unity!
Holy, holy, holy is My name! . . ."
Remember this well: that the A is to be practiced at the be-
ginning of the exercise and the O at the end. The creation of the
universe began with the fission of the Universal
Spirit into the
multitude of individuals,
and it will end with the return of these
individuals to the Great Unity, after a long course of enjoyment
and suffering. Just as the colorful multitude of the letters of the
alphabet is initiated by the extended arms of the A, it will end
with the redeeming circle of the concluding O.
The Significance
Of Folding
Your Hands
You will learn to know the deeper significance
of folding your
hands while praying. The more a human being moves his arms,
the more energy he wastes needlessly;
he incessantly
throws
away little invisible particles of energy that are then lost to him.
A person who wants to gather and compose himself must fold
his hands. Through this gesture, he himself will benefit
from
those escaping energies. The left and the right hand have differ-
ent polarities.
When they are interlocked,
they impregnate
each
other; that is, there is an exchange of current which is to the
advantage
of the person praying. That which would otherwise
be needlessly
wasted
now
serves
one's
inner
development.
Anyone who is exhausted and sits quietly, closes his eyes, folds
his hands and breathes calmly and slowly will quickly notice in
his own body a significant increase in energy.
The length of the aforementioned
meditation exercise is not
as important as its proper execution. Do this only when you are
180
in the proper frame of mind. It will be easily ascertainable
when
the goal of this exercise has been reached.
Once more, observe the contrast between
your hands and
feet. The feet are plump and not as finely articulated.
The hands
are slender-boned
and inspired by inner life. The feet are di-
rected towards the motherly lap of the earth, the hands upwards
to the sun. Remember:
The more spiritual
the character
of a
human being, the finer the bone structure of his hands and the
more plentiful will be the universal runes which line the palms
of the hands.
The cosmic spirit, your father, imprints His heavenly
seal
into both of your hands. They outline your career, the stations
of your life, everything
you touch upon; they mark the crucial
points at which, in accordance
with your will, you must make
the great decisions
and which determine
your further develop-
ment through future incarnations
or your eventual deliverance
from the obligation of rebirth.
Have you ever noticed that the writings or lines of the right
hand are different
from the left? Make the effort to compare
them. Should you be experienced
in chirology,
then you know
that the lines in the left hand represent that share of your spiri-
tual inheritance
which has been handed down to you; in other
words, they represent
the tendencies
and possibilities
that you
brought with you from earlier incarnations,
whereas
the right
hand indicates what you will do with these possibilities.
There-
fore, the right hand indicates how far you have awakened spiri-
tually and how far you have consciously
prepared
yourself for
the life plan which God has designed for you.
When you fold your hands, you join your past with your
future and meld both into one unity; you form a closed ring, an
eternal
presence
that is removed
from time. The left is the
181
enduring
hand and the right
hand the active
one, and only
together
do they form an organic
whole. And here we touch
upon a universal secret which requires an explanation.
God's
Biform
The uncreated
spirit reveals Himself in two forms; He has two
faces, both of which are of equal importance,
and they are only
perfect when united. They are called the male and female prin-
ciple, or God the Father
and God the Mother.
What science
specifies
as positive
and negative
electricity,
as positive
and
negative magnetism, is the expression
of the very same duality.
What we call day and night, life and death, is based on the same
principle.
The living produces works and personifies
the "male
principle";
the dying sacrifices
itself entirely
and personifies
the "female
principle"
in its highest potency.
Everything
that
has ever been created, the entire world of formation,
is subject
to this law. It has its day and its night, whether that be suns,
planets and moons, or plants, animals and human beings. Every-
thing which we call "life" comes forth solely from this contrast,
this mutual struggle between two fundamental
energies
which
do not find their fulfillment
and highest determination
through
the defeat
of one and the victory
of the other,
but in their
equilibrated
harmony, in the perfection of their equilibrium.
There is no single thing in existence which is only male or
only female. The struggle of the two energies takes place in the
organism
of the human body more so than anywhere
else, so
that it therefore becomes the scene of action of cosmic revolu-
tion. If we take an overview of the development
of human civi-
lizations,
the ups and downs of nations in history, we become
aware that at certain times the father-energy
or father deity has
182
had the upper hand in the consciousness
of human beings and
enjoyed
the higher worship,
while at other times the mother-
energy or mother deity has prevailed.
In the south of Europe,
you will find to this day a worship of the Virgin Mary which
represents
a strong memory of the ancient Mother of the Uni-
verse, who was held in high esteem by all the nations
of the
world'under
many different names. Her name was Isis in ancient
Egypt; to this day she is called Kwan Yin in the Far East; in
other places she is called Maya or Maria; in all these instances
you are dealing with the same superior universal thought. Is not
the Madonna
portrayed
standing on the crescent
of the moon
and surrounded
by a wreath of stars even to this day? Ancient
cosmic symbols sparkle, but most of the devout are completely
unaware of them as such.
The World As Love Mystery
Man and woman are the division of God. Their eternal seeking
and finding each other, separating from each other and finding
each other again, determines
all life; in truth this is a high love
mystery. God the Father is on the whole not thinkable
without
God the Mother. He would be only half of a whole, and hence
imperfect.
The eternal
procreating
father-energy
requires
an
eternal,
conceiving,
form-giving,
bearing
mother-energy.
You
may call the former primordial
Spirit and the latter primordial
substance; here the fundamental
truth is of importance,
not the
name.
Without
love, the world could not exist. What allows the
celestial bodies to rotate in blissful rhythm around their central
points, what allows the planets to revolve around the sun, what
183
allows the negatively
charged electrons
to revolve around the
positive atomic nucleus, can only be love!
Everything
you see around you as "life," from birth to the
grave, is set and kept in motion by love. Attraction
and repul-
sion are two components
and they do not form a unit until they
work together.
The birth of any organism is the birth of a se-
quence of love, its death a passing over into another sequence.
Being properly prepared for death means to train yourself for a
new and higher
sequence
of life. Therefore
anyone who has
loved only himself will find it very difficult
to die. Show me
how you die, and I will tell you who you were.
Man and Wife Within
You
The world is made of fire and water, light and darkness, yes and
no.
The earthly
concepts
of "father"
and "mother"
are the
lower mortal symbols of an infinite, much more profound,
and
higher
pair of divinity
and energy
which
stand
behind
and
above, in which the unrecognizable
oneness reveals itself. They
meet again and again, struggle with each other, balance
each
other and produce
together
the symbol of their harmony,
the
child. When this is properly understood, it is a high symbol, the
highest of all to one who is truly cognizant.
However,
under-
stand that while you are in your human, earthly reality, you are
prolonging
suffering
in an endless
chain. What child has not
been born to suffer?!
The true mystery of generation
lies not in external
but in
inner procreation.
You know that there is not one being which is only male or
only female; this applies to human beings as well. Observe the
184
nipples of a man and the facial hair of a woman. And how often
do you find a male spirit in a female body or a female spirit in a
male body? We are hermaphrodites
and, in love, a whole man
strives for a whole woman. That occurs in the external as well
as in the inner love which takes place in the sanctuary of your
body. The wisdom of old age rests essentially
upon this inner
love; the primary sexual orientation
subsides and the suppressed
secondary sexual orientation
comes forth. The completion
once
sought for on the outside is sought for on the inside; and it is
found. An inner procreation
takes place, which renews, delivers
and liberates the old human being if he is able to master it.
Mystical
Love
Whoever has passed through the mystical death, and I hope you
have done so, no longer sees in external procreation
the crown
and goal of his life. Whoever has found the divine lady does not
require female servants. He regards them as messengers,
sym-
bols or analogies,
but knows himself to be independent
of the
compulsion
to procreation
which
controls
the whole
world.
What he loves is no longer the human being, but the deity,
which approaches
him in the form or shape of this or that per-
son and speaks to him through the mouths of different
human
beings. It is the deity which he, at the same time, carries and
feels within himself.
In other
words,
he no longer
cares
about
the external
reflections
which disappear in the space of time like smoke, but
procreates
with the divine energy within himself, the immortal
child, the inner Christ.
185
The Very Holy Three
Here now lies the mystery of the time-honored
number three.
God the Father within you as the procreating
will and God the
Mother within you as the illuminated Holy Ghost with her eter-
nal virgin soul, procreate in mystical love the Divine Child, the
son, which again is you yourself, your higher, immortal God-I.
Draw an equilateral
triangle and you will then have the appro-
priate symbol of this procedure.
It can only be understood
in
words by those who have lived through it and gone through this
process internally.
The trinity which is taught by the old relig-
ions indicates nothing else but the Holy Three.
Now, there are certain steps which you can take to promote
and support this inner spiritual birth which is the actual goal of
religious
development.
Everything
these letters
want to teach
you
essentially
serves
this
goal.
Beautiful
pictures
of the
Madonna that you view with the proper attitude and upon which
you concentrate
will serve you well, in addition
to good pic-
tures of Christ that represent the living, blessing, or resurrected
Christ and not, of course, the crucified Christ. Christ should not
remain on the cross within you, but should be awakened. He has
been crucified
long enough.
The time has come wherein
He
must be taken off the cross and placed in His proper place, in
the seat on the right hand of God. Meditate
on "the Christ in
me," whether you acquire an insight into Him in human form or
whether you feel Him as the sun within you which rises over
evil and good. Or meditate
on words such as "eternal
love,"'
"blissfulness,"'
"mercy and light."
186
The Cross Exercise:
"The Vital Water"
*
Preliminary
remark: Your male-female
nature reveals
itself in
many details in the structure of your body, which you must dis-
cover, at least in part, by yourself. Pay attention to certain im-
portant
symbolisms.
The
vertical
line has
always
been
the
expression
of the concept of the male, whereas the horizontal
is
the expression
of the female. Meditate on why this must be so.
When you draw a cross, it represents
the collaboration
of the
male and female principles,
and where both lines intersect
is
logically
the point where the creative energy is strongest
and
where it immediately becomes effective.
If you spread your arms sideways in a horizontal direction,
you form this mystical cross; you yourself are a representation
of man and wife in reciprocal action. Your own body, your own
Inner, becomes
the scene of action of the creative
activity
of
both fundamental
energies. There are gestures, positions or pos-
tures of the body which contain
a greater
meaning
than that
which is understood superficially
through a point of view that is
coarsely or mechanically
inclined. Yes, bodily functions
are at
times the cover of a higher spiritual principle
which will only
blossom in you when you have matured!
If the preponderance
within you is male and if you are,
through your upbringing,
inclined to male activities,
it is of ne-
cessity first to strengthen,
develop, and practice the female en-
ergies within you. This occurs by getting in touch with the uni-
versal cosmic female energy which exists outside of you.
Implementation:
Face south, close your eyes, and take the
position of the cross. The palms of your hands face upwards and
at the same time assume a receptive
gesture. Now concentrate
187
with your entire inner attention upon the central point in both
palms of your hands. In a very short while, you will feel how
the current of the astral light flows over and into you at this
point. You feel a prickle,
a suction, a very fine ripple of the
highest and most peculiar nature. This perception has nothing to
do
with
autosuggestion.
However,
this
state
can
only
be
achieved if you are sufficiently
prepared;
otherwise
this effort
will be a waste. It would be without purpose to begin the second
part of this exercise if you have not completed the first part.
In regards to the second part of this exercise,
you have to
be satisfied
with indications,
which will suffice to inform you
enough, provided
the "love from above" will help you. Know
that the breathing
process conceals a love mystery. Inhalation,
exhalation,
and breath-retention
are the different
phases of the
procreational
and birthing process. Its deeper significance
will
be revealed to you under the proper circumstances
at the right
moment.
Do you want to procreate
the Divine
Child within you?
Then be worthy of the Divine Child. . .
The Significance
Of Christmas
If you have penetrated
deeply enough into these matters, then
Christmas,
along with many other things, will unveil itself as a
highly meaningful
analogy. An inner process is here appropri-
ately characterized
through an external
symbolism.
Ask your-
self: Who is "Joseph"?
Who is "Maria"? Why was this festival
celebrated
during the days which usher in the return of the sun
for the northern hemisphere?
Why does the Christ child come
into the world in an animal stable? And what is your opinion
188
about the profound symbolism of the Christmas tree, which now
shint1s above our Yuletide festivities?
Contemplate
these matters with your heart. . . If you have
followed
all of these instructions
and have practiced
them as
they were intended, then you know what the sage wanted to say
when he said: "Behold, all things are becoming new!"
From now on you stand perfectly happy and reconciled
in
the changing world of appearances.
You have found the anchor-
age which can never be lost.
The Might Of Renunciation
You have already
begun to make a peculiar
discovery.
You
yourself
are transformed,
and with this transformation
you at-
tain everything that you do and say in a transformed
sense. Ini-
tiall y, it is a new and surprising
power.
Your thoughts
and
wishes begin to realize themselves in physical form before your
very eyes, where and how and when you expect it the least. The
fulfillment
of old yearnings
awaits
you somewhere
on your
path. The earlier slow pace of your life's carriage increases un-
expectedly into a fast gallop. It seems that the hindrances which
have remained
with you for so long have now fallen by the
wayside.
With your inner life, your outer life will change as
well.
However, the word that you speak with full consciousness
and will shall achieve an unrecognized
significance.
It becomes
a cosmic order which brings serving energies
or powers of a
very high potency into motion. You will learn to see the magic
of blessings
in an entirely new light. With these new powers,
you will load an immense responsibility
upon your soul. Always
189
be mindful of this, even when it comes to the most trivial mat-
ters in the course of your life!
The Teachings
Of The
Spiritual
Vacuum
To reiterate the arcanum of these effects is called renunciation.
It is not a renunciation
that is learned superficially
or through
autosuggestion,
or
a renunciation
for
selfish
purposes,
an
imaginary
renunciation,
but an inner renunciation
that is true
and mystical, where it makes no difference whether one lives in
poverty or wealth, humility or splendor, a renunciation
through
which the things of this world are in truth only a meaningless
garment. Being perfectly happy or having no wishes whatsoever
guards the entrance to these mysteries,
and nobody will reach
the inner sanctum of the temple who does not enter it with clean
feet.
What happens in such a case is this: By not wishing for
anything in regards to an occurrence,
a vacuum is formed in the
causal world. As little as outer nature permits a vacuum, neither
does the spiritual
world allow it; instead,
it seeks to fill it as
quickly as possible.
This equalization
can only lie in the ful-
fillment
of that which you have chosen not to desire, because
that is the thing which corresponds precisely with the vacuum.
You see, within all this you will find a contradiction
with
which you must somehow come to terms. When wishes that you
no longer harbor fulfill themselves as a result of this renuncia-
tion, they are therefore
no longer fulfillments
of "wishes."
In
other words: The fulfillment
of a wish that has truly been re-
nounced
is a meaningless
thing for the true mystic.
And it
should be! Here too, infinite wisdom knows exactly what she is
190
doing; she lays the whole world at the feet of the mature human
being. Only he knows how to properly make use of it, because
he no longer takes more of the treasures of the world than what
he requires for his higher tasks.
Universe
Meditations
*
Go outside on a clear night and look for a quiet and protected
place under the starry sky where you can be alone and undis-
turbed.
Should
it be winter,
practice
this meditation
in your
room, perhaps by a window. Begin by examining the most beau-
tiful and largest constellations;
remain longer with those that
have the purest and strongest flames, for instance Sirius (in the
winter) and Capella or Vega (in the summer).
Now assume the posture of directing your eyes towards the
sky, the meditation
position to which you have become accus-
tomed. Within you, call forth one of the following concepts as
plastically as you possibly can.
(a) The Heavenly
Tree*: You are standing
under an lm-
mense tree. You do not see the trunk or the branches
because
they are in darkness.
However,
the lights of thousands
upon
thousands
of stars sparkle at the tips of the branches.
Imagine
this in the finest detail; number the stars with numbers
which
yet remain within your comprehension.
You are standing in awe
under
an indescribably
immense
Christmas
tree.
The
lights
sparkle for the highest of celebrations:
You were born to your-
self, you were given to yourself as a gift. Should you not be
grateful?
Stretch your arms out and speak the Lord's
Prayer slowly
and solemnly into the radiant sky.
191
(b) God's
Matrimonial
House*:
The
entire
universe
is
God's
matrimonial
house. All infinite life in the radiant
vast-
ness is the constant
wedding celebration
of the exalted
One,
wherein man and wife embrace each other. Man and wife are
the poles that keep life in motion. Every light that you see is a
song of triumph of the Loved One, past the infinity of space.
Know this and feel this: God is Love!
You too fell from the colossal universal tree as a fruit, so
that you can serve the High Love. Without this Love, you would
not be. Without this Love, you would not exist. Within this lies
your entire destiny, chosen and agreed upon by you. "He that
remains in love remains in God and God in him!" Or, as the Bi-
ble says: "And he that dwelleth
in love dwelleth
in God and
God in him." (I John 4: 16). Penetrate
more deeply into these
thoughts.
Allow them to penetrate
you totally. Then begin the
following exercise.
Star Breathing
*
Without
losing sight of the whole, firmly envisage
the most
beautiful constellation
in the heavens. Slowly inhale and let the
following thought penetrate you as intensely as possible:
"With
this breath I inhale the power of love of the universe!" Be mind-
ful that you are blood from the blood of the stars. Bear in mind
that, through breathing, the cosmic currents of energy pass over
into your circulatory
system and immediately become blood and
flesh within you. Bear in mind that through this star breathing
you are inseparably
integrated
into the great chain of the uni-
versal cycle. Let these words come alive in you: "One with
You, very holy God! . . ."
192
Midnight
Communion
*
When all the voices of the day are silent, your soul should be
awake. When the exalted Mother spreads Her hands, your heart
should be listening.
Unnoticed,
convert a small table with a white or black ta-
blecloth into an altar. Draw a perfect circle with coal or crayon,
and in the circle an equilateral
triangle,
in such a manner that
the tips of the triangle touch the circle. Place a white candle at
each of these three contact points.
At the central point of the circle and triangle place a small
piece of white bread, enough for one bite; in addition, place a
cup of wine in the center with enough wine for one mouthful.
Ceremony: Now light the three candles while you speak in
a low and solemn voice:
"In the name of the Father!"
(light the first candle)
"In the name of the Son!"
(light the second candle)
"In the name of the Holy Ghost!"
(light the third candle)
Then kneel in front of this altar and immerse yourself
in
the holiness of the moment, and speak in a low and penetrating
VOice:
"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God. . ." (Pause)
"Heavenly Father,
Creator, Preserver and Transformer
of the Universe,
be with me!"
193
"Heavenly Mother,
holy Soul of the World,
Who has carried me in Her lap from the beginning,
be with me!"
"O Son of God,
crucified by His own will,
slain, descended into the depths,
reborn in me by divine will,
risen from the dead,
risen to blissfulness,
has found his way home into his Father's
house!"
"Very holy Father, very holy Mother,
with you I am united in life and death,
I am united with You forever."
Take the bread, eat and speak:
"This is my body, which was given for all!"
Take the wine, drink it and speak:
"This is my blood, which was shed for all!
OM!"
Remain for a while in deep devotion, then get up, extinguish the
candles, and remove the cloth with the circle.
194
Epilogue and Appeal
My brother, we have traveled a far distance.
Should you have
followed
me from beginning
to end, then you have passed
through an external and inner development
which, as intended,
will leave permanent traces in your life. You have experienced
a mystical transformation,
a new spiritual birth which, like any
new birth, is connected
with pain and sacrifice,
and without
which the good to which we aspire cannot be reached.
In these letters I have attempted to give you absolutely
as
much as one can give to a stranger. I have expressed myself as
clearly as it is allowed in respect to the difficult and responsible
subject matter. I am fully aware that many things have been said
concerning
which you can only read between
the lines
and
which,
when taken
seriously,
cannot
without
reservation
be
placed in every hand. However, not only do books have their
destiny, they also have their good angels. This book was written
with the honest wish to help the sincere seeker, but will surely
escape the keen eyes of dishonest contemporaries,
who will be
blinded to it. Besides that, it has been established
from a purely
psycho-technical
point of view that no one who has not been
called will reach this sanctuary. The admission
to this sanctu-
ary, thank God, cannot be purchased,
obtained
by trickery
or
coerced.
It can only be facilitated
through
sacrifice
and, of
course, through the most demanding sacrifice of which a human
being is capable. Whosoever intends to exploit these letters for
selfish and immoral purposes will bite on granite or will inflict
upon himself the greatest harm.
The echo which my attempt has found is not without prom-
ise. Many have already begun to enter upon the difficult
path
which I have indicated.
And from these people,
the invisible
195
chivalry will be recruited
which will work in secrecy and will
form the guardsmen
for the good in future spiritual
struggles.
Throughout
entire countries where the Germanic tongue is spo-
ken, scattered
islands
are coming into being which are inde-
pendent
of boundaries,
representing
purposeful
unity for the
struggle of the light, unassailable
because they are not organ-
ized as visible alliances.
Much greater, however, are the numbers of those who have
accepted
these
letters
in sympathy
without
obligating
them-
selves to their practical
implementation.
The reason for this is
the inner resistance
of the suspicious,
mistrustful
"modern hu-
man being"
against anything
which seems to be compulsory.
But the basic requirement
for success with these exercises
lies
precisely in the voluntariness
of the devotion. There, the exter-
nal circumstances
of the esoteric exercise practice
places hin-
drances in the path. For example, it is very difficult
for those
that are married to practice
sexual abstinence
for a longer pe-
riod of time. But as a preliminary
measure towards the aspired
transformation,
this sexual abstinence is absolutely necessary. It
should be mentioned
that it is a transitional
stage which does
not have to be adhered
to as strictly
once the goal has been
reached.
Also, those people are mistaken who assume that these let-
ters are a lifelong extinction
of all enjoyment,
and who thus
commence a permanent
asceticism
which opposes all pleasure.
Quite the contrary,
the attempt is made here to bring forth the
deepest values from life. Whosoever
wants to be in the deep-
water channel must, in order to find it, leave the mud-flats
in
which most of his fellow beings are so cheerful
and satisfied
and splash about totally unaware. Once he has reached this new
point of view and has firmly ascertained
this secure anchorage,
196
he may be merry with the merry makers, human among human
beings, so long as this is not understood as excess in any direc-
tion. Certainly the world and its "delights"
will no longer have
the same meaning to him as they do to other people.
It is a fact that hunger is the best cook. All those who over-
feed, all those who have ruined their stomachs and their livers,
this is for their enticement!
Yes, even a meager life-soup gains
a new, unimagined appeal when, for once, nothing is in the pot.
My dear reader, it goes without saying that these letters are
imperfect,
like everything
that
is written
by human
hands.
Originally
I had planned to follow these letters with an eighth
and a ninth letter in order to remove some of this imperfection.
However,
the time to complement
these letters has not come
yet. That is why, for the time being, the Seven Letters remain. I
have, however, taken care for the completion of their content.
I am certain that nobody will read them without benefit,
even when he does not draw any practical
conclusions.
One or
the other truth will be impressed
upon him and will never be
lost again. Our temporary
soul is ill and requires
a physician.
She is ill because of a madness for money and competition.
Na-
tions, classes and individuals suffer severely because of it.
What we would require would be quiet islands, far away
from
everyday
life,
where
the healthy
equilibrium
of souls
would be established
again upon anew,
stable and sound basis.
Not "sanatoriums"
where, through electrical
currents, massage,
and rest-cures
the sinful body is energized
for new sins. Not
psychoanalytical
healing institutions
whose main weapon is the
systematic unraveling of erotic experiences
and desires, placing
a particular emphasis on the animal instead of overcoming it.
I am
speaking
of
free
cloisters
which
make
it their
responsibility
to retrain
and return the soul to her own high
197
nature,
of
free
cloisters
in
which
the
world-weary
and
disillusioned,
the life pilgrim hungry for God and spirituality,
may find refuge for a while (and not just for a short period of
time), with the assurance of finding an inner development
and a
new, non-materialistic
philosophy of life which alone will bring
him permanent peace. I am speaking of guideposts to happiness,
houses of tranquility
where all healing methods and remedies
passed on from the ancient mystical
systems are offered
in a
modern garment, such as proper concentration,
contemplation,
musical meditation,
wherein ceremonial rites light up venerated
mysteries
and
where
seekers
are
internally
exalted
and
fecundated.
In short, I am speaking
of places
where today's
totally scatterbrained
human being may find, in brotherly
love,
the internal and external help which he so urgently needs (not
"business love," which you pay for whether it be first or second
class).
I send these words out into the world so that they may
knock on the right doors. I wonder whether I will hear an echo?
