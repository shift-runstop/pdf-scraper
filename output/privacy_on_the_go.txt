Message from the Attorney General
California is the epicenter of modern innovation. Whether in the information 
technology sector, the entertainment industry, or the development of sustainable 
energy, the technologies that we create are transforming the world. California 
has proudly led these innovations, not just by producing new technologies, but 
also by ensuring that these innovations are used responsibly. In California, we 
have some of the strongest consumer protection laws in the country. While 
it is easy to conceive of innovation and regulation as mutually exclusive, 
California is proof that we can do both. We can innovate responsibly. 
  
The world has gone mobile. Today, 85 percent of American adults own a cell 
phone and over half of them use their phones to access the Internet. The mobile app marketplace 
is also booming with more than 1,600 new mobile apps being introduced every day. These apps 
allow us to do everything from streaming movies to hailing a cab to viewing our own X-ray and 
ultrasound images.
 
Along with the many wonderful capabilities these apps offer, we remain mindful that the mobile 
environment also poses uncharted privacy challenges, such as the difficulty of providing 
consumers with meaningful information about privacy choices on small screens and the many 
players who may have access to sensitive user information. These are challenges that we must 
confront and that we must resolve in a way that appropriately protects privacy while not unduly 
stifling innovation. As Attorney General, I am commited to ensuring that this balance is maintained. 
Last year, we took a first step in addressing these challenges with a Joint Statement of Principles 
that was adopted by the leading operators of mobile application platforms. That agreement 
improves consumer privacy protections and is designed to help bring mobile apps in compliance 
with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. As a result of the app platform companies’ 
implementation of the principles, consumers can now review an app’s privacy policy in the app 
store, before downloading the app. 
We are now offering this set of privacy practice recommendations to assist app developers, 
and others, in considering privacy early in the development process. We have arrived at these 
recommendations after consulting a broad spectrum of stakeholders: mobile carriers, device 
manufacturers, operating system developers, app developers, app platform providers, mobile ad 
networks, security and privacy professionals, technologists, academics, and privacy advocates. 
We are grateful for their comments and look forward to working with all stakeholders in 
promoting and adopting these recommendations. It is my hope that our recommendations along 
with continued private-public collaborations will contribute to improving privacy practices in the 
mobile marketplace. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Attorney General Kamala D. Harris

Executive Summary
The pocket computers we carry with us – our cell phones, tablets and such – not only 
allow us to entertain ourselves, but with nearly a million applications available today, they 
also offer a variety of other capabilities. Mobile applications (apps) allow us not just to 
read books, play games, listen to music, and take photos and videos, but also to monitor 
our heart rate, start the car remotely on a dark night, find a nearby restaurant, and pay 
for purchases on-the-spot.
With their expanding functionality, mobile devices are subject to the privacy risks of the 
online world and to some that are unique to the mobile sphere. Their small screen size 
makes communicating privacy practices and choices to consumers especially challenging. 
Consumers care about mobile privacy: a recent survey found that over half of Americans had 
uninstalled or decided not to install an app because of concerns about its privacy practices.1 
 
As part of a larger initiative aimed at improving privacy protections in the mobile sphere, 
the California Attorney General began by forging an agreement with the major app platform 
companies: Amazon, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Research In Motion, 
and later Facebook.2 These app platform companies agreed to principles designed to 
improve privacy protections in the mobile environment and to bring the industry in line with 
California law requiring mobile apps that collect personal information to have a privacy 
policy. The principles include making an app’s privacy policy available to consumers on the 
app platform, before they download the app.
The mobile app industry is growing fast, but it is still in the early stages of development, 
with practitioners who are not all alert to privacy implications and how to address them. To 
help educate the industry and promote privacy best practices, the Attorney General’s Privacy 
Enforcement and Protection Unit has prepared Privacy on the Go: Recommendations for the 
Mobile Ecosystem. The recommendations, which in many places offer greater protection than 
afforded by existing law, are intended to encourage app developers and other players in the 
mobile sphere to consider privacy at the outset of the design process. 
Recognizing that the legally required general privacy policy is not always the most effective 
way to get consumers’ attention, Privacy on the Go recommends a “surprise minimization” 
approach. This approach means supplementing the general privacy policy with enhanced 
measures to alert users and give them control over data practices that are not related to an 
app’s basic functionality or that involve sensitive information.

PRIVACY ON THE GO
Highlights of  Recommendations
For App Developers
• Start with a data checklist to review the 
personally identifiable data your app 
could collect and use it to make decisions 
on your privacy practices. 
• Avoid or limit collecting personally 
identifiable data not needed for your 
app’s basic functionality.
• Develop a privacy policy that is clear, 
accurate, and conspicuously accessible 
to users and potential users.
• Use enhanced measures – “special 
notices” or the combination of a short 
privacy statement and privacy controls – 
to draw users’ attention to data practices 
that may be unexpected and to enable 
them to make meaningful choices. 
For App Platform Providers
• Make app privacy policies accessible 
from the app platform so that they may  
be reviewed before a user downloads  
an app. 
• Use the platform to educate users on   
 
mobile privacy.
For Mobile Ad Networks
• Avoid using out-of-app ads that are   
 
delivered by modifying browser settings  
 
or placing icons on the mobile desktop.
• Have a privacy policy and provide it  
 
to the app developers who will enable  
 
the delivery of targeted ads through   
 
your network.
• Move away from the use of 
interchangeable device-specific identifiers 
and transition to app-specific or temporary 
device identifiers. 
For Operating System Developers
• Develop global privacy settings that   
allow users to control the data and device 
features accessible to apps.
For Mobile Carriers
• Leverage your ongoing relationship   
 
with mobile customers to educate them  
 
on mobile privacy and particularly on  
 
children’s privacy.

Mobile Privacy Issues
Our smart phones and other mobile 
devices are pocket computers. They 
now have the power and functionality 
of desktop computers – and the privacy 
and security risks inherent to the 
Internet. Like our desktop and laptop 
computers, our mobile devices may 
contain, or are capable of accessing, 
large amounts of personal information: 
contact information of our friends and 
associates, family photos and videos, and 
our web browsing history, among other 
details. And like personal computers, 
smart phones, and other mobile devices 
are targets for malware and spyware.4 
These always-on, always-on-us devices 
pose additional privacy challenges that 
are unique to the mobile space. Mobile 
devices may store types of user information 
not usually found on personal computers, 
such as telephone call logs, text messages, 
and a history of our location. Mobile 
devices and apps are also leading to 
new forms and combinations of user and 
device-related data that may pose new 
risks to users’ privacy and security. 
Another challenge is the devices’ small 
screens, which make the effective 
communication of privacy practices 
and user choices difficult. Furthermore, 
although the app economy is thriving, 
the mobile app industry is in a relatively 
early development stage, with developers 
focusing on getting new products to 
market as quickly as possible, sometimes 
without adequate consideration of privacy. 
Recent studies, for example, have found 
The Movement to Mobile
Mobile devices are integral to modern life 
and their use is growing rapidly. Today, 
85 percent of American adults have a 
cell phone, 45 percent a smart phone, 
61 percent a laptop, 25 percent a tablet 
computer, and 18 percent an e-book reader. 
Over half of adult cell phone owners use 
the Internet on their phones, twice the rate 
in 2009. And nearly one third of cell owners 
report that their phone is the primary, or 
only, way they access the Internet.1 
The ever-expanding capabilities of mobile 
devices have created an exploding market 
for applications (apps) that allow us not 
just to read books, play games, listen to 
music, and take photos and videos, but 
also to monitor our heart rate, start the car 
remotely on a dark night, find a nearby 
restaurant, and pay for purchases on-the-
spot. Recent reports estimate that there 
are more than a million apps available on 
the primary mobile platforms, and more 
than 1,600 new apps are added daily.2 
Clearly, many consumers find value in 
mobile apps and are eager to try new ones 
as they are released. But many of these 
same consumers are also concerned 
about privacy. A recent study found that 
more than half of mobile app users had 
uninstalled or decided not to install an 
app because of concerns about its privacy 
practices.3 Addressing these concerns 
is essential to protect consumers and to 
foster trust and confidence in this market.

PRIVACY ON THE GO
that many mobile apps did not provide 
users with privacy policy statements at 
all.5 This represents not just a failure in 
transparency, but it also suggests a lack of 
attention to the apps’ privacy practices.
In an important step to strengthen the 
privacy protections for users of mobile 
applications, the California Attorney 
General in early 2012 announced a Joint 
Statement of Principles, endorsed by the 
companies whose platforms comprise 
the majority of the mobile app market 
(Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, 
Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, and Research 
In Motion). The principles are intended 
to ensure that mobile apps comply with 
applicable privacy laws such as the 
California Online Privacy Protection Act, 
and include the conspicuous posting of 
a privacy policy by mobile apps when 
required by law, a means to make the 
policy available from the app platform 
before downloading, a way for users 
to report non-compliant apps to the 
platform provider, a process to respond 
to such reports, and a pledge to further 
work with the Attorney General on best 
practices for mobile privacy.6 As of October 
2012, all the app store companies who 
joined the agreement reported that 
they had implemented the principles.
The agreement with the platform providers 
has already had an impact on privacy 
practices. A June 2012 study found that 
the percentage of the most popular apps 
with some form of access to a privacy 
policy improved significantly since their 
similar study in September 2011. In just 
eight months, free apps on the Apple 
App Store platform with a privacy policy 
doubled, from 40 percent to 84 percent, 
and those on the Google Play platform 
increased from 70 percent to 76 percent.7  
Recommended Practices 
The Attorney General is committed to 
increasing compliance with California’s 
privacy laws. In July 2012, the Attorney 
General created the Privacy Enforcement 
and Protection Unit, with the mission of 
protecting the inalienable right to privacy 
conferred by the California Constitution. 
The Privacy Unit enforces state and federal 
privacy laws, and develops programs to 
educate consumers and businesses on 
privacy rights and best practices. Privacy 
on the Go is part of the effort to encourage 
businesses to adopt privacy best practices. 
Several respected organizations have 
recently issued privacy principles and 
policies for the mobile industry.8 The 
shared themes of these sets of principles 
have informed our recommended 
practices: transparency about data 
practices, limits on the collection and 
retention of data, meaningful choices 
for users, security, and accountability 
of all industry actors for privacy. 
We offer these privacy practice 
recommendations to assist the mobile 
ecosystem in the ongoing efforts to develop 
privacy standards. Our hope is that privacy- 
respectful practices such as those we are 
recommending here will be adopted by app 
developers and others, enabling consumers 
to make informed choices from the vast 
array of mobile apps while maintaining 
the level of privacy control they desire. 
Our recommendations, which in many 
places offer greater protection than afforded 
by existing law, are intended to encourage 
all players in the mobile marketplace 
to consider privacy implications at the 
outset of the design process. They are 
also intended to encourage the alignment 
of architectural and functional decisions 
5
PRIVACY ON THE GO
with the widely accepted Fair Information 
Practice Principles (FIPPs). The FIPPs form 
the basis for many privacy codes and laws 
in different parts of the world, including the 
federal Privacy Act of 1974 and the similar 
California Information Practices Act of 1977.
Like many actors in the mobile ecosystem, 
the Attorney General is also participating 
in the multi-stakeholder process facilitated 
by the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration (NTIA) to 
develop an enforceable code of conduct 
on mobile app transparency.10 While our 
recommendations engage a broader range 
of mobile privacy issues than the NTIA is 
expected to address at this time, we hope 
that this document will be useful in the 
ongoing NTIA process.  
Surprise Minimization
The basic approach recommended here 
is to minimize surprises to users from 
unexpected privacy practices. An obvious 
way to avoid such unpleasant surprises is 
to avoid collecting personally identifiable 
data from users that are not needed for an 
app’s basic functionality.
Another important step is to make 
an app’s general privacy policy easy 
to understand and readily available 
before a mobile app is downloaded. 
It is widely recognized, however, 
that in order to make meaningful 
choices, consumers need clearer, 
shorter notices of certain privacy 
practices.11 This is particularly true 
in the small-screen 
mobile environment. 
Our recommended 
approach is to 
supplement the 
legally required 
general privacy 
policy with enhanced 
measures to alert users 
and give them control over 
data practices that are not related 
to an app’s basic functionality or that 
involve sensitive information. 
Such enhanced notice and control might 
be provided through “special notices,” 
delivered in context and just-in-time. For 
example, operating systems that use 
location data deliver a notice just before 
collecting the data and give users an 
opportunity to allow or prevent the practice.
Another way to achieve the same end is to 
make readily available from within an app 
both a short privacy statement highlighting 
potentially unexpected practices, and 
privacy controls that allow users to make, 
review, and change their privacy choices.

Shared Accountability
We are addressing these initial 
recommendations primarily to app 
developers, but we include some 
recommendations to other actors in  
the ecosystem. 
Protecting consumer privacy is a team 
sport. The decisions and actions of many 
players, operating individually and jointly, 
determine privacy outcomes for users. 
Hardware manufacturers, operating system 
developers, mobile telecommunications 
carriers, advertising networks, and mobile 
app developers all play a part, and 
their collaboration is crucial to enabling 
consumers to enjoy mobile apps without 
having to sacrifice their privacy.
By offering consumers greater transparency 
and control over how their information 
is collected and used in the mobile 
ecosystem, the industry will build the trust 
that is critical for the app market to flourish. 
Key Terms
The following definitions are for key terms 
as they are used in this document.
Personally identifiable data are  
any data linked to a person or persistently 
linked to a mobile device: data that can 
identify a person via personal information 
or a device via a unique identifier. 
Included are user-entered data, as 
well as automatically collected data.
Sensitive information is personally 
identifiable data about which users are 
likely to be concerned, such as precise 
geo-location; financial and medical 
information; passwords; stored information 
such as contacts, photos, and videos; and 
children’s information. 
PRIVACY ON THE GO
Special notice is a timely, contextual 
notice that alerts users to a data practice 
that is likely to be unexpected because it 
involves sensitive information or data not 
required for an app’s basic functionality. 
Short privacy statement is a privacy  
policy designed to be read on a mobile 
device, highlighting data practices that 
involve sensitive information or are likely to 
be unexpected because they involve data 
not required for an app’s basic functionality.
Privacy controls are settings  
available within an app or an operating 
system that allow users to make or 
revise choices offered in the general 
privacy policy about the collection of 
their personally identifiable data.
General privacy policy is a 
comprehensive statement of a company’s 
or organization’s policies and practices 
related to an application, covering the 
accessing, collecting, using, disclosing, 
sharing, and otherwise handling 
of personally identifiable data.
Acknowledgements
In developing our recommendations  
we benefited from the advice of a  
broad spectrum of stakeholders: mobile 
carriers, device manufacturers, operating 
system developers, app developers, app 
platform providers, mobile ad networks, 
security and privacy professionals, 
technologists, academics, and privacy 
advocates. Their comments and 
contributions are greatly appreciated.

II. Recommendations for App Developers
The app economy in the U.S. is estimated to 
account for 466,000 jobs, up from zero  
in 2007 when the iPhone was introduced.12  
The burgeoning mobile app industry is 
primarily made up of small businesses, often 
individual developers, whose newly formed 
industry associations have expressed a 
commitment to respect the privacy of their 
users.13 We offer these recommendations to 
help in the development of privacy standards 
for the mobile app industry.  
In this section, we discuss ways that 
developers can build privacy into their 
apps. We begin by encouraging the use 
of a data checklist, which can be used in 
making decisions about privacy practices, 
in designing an app, and in generating 
privacy notices and statements. We go on to 
discuss certain practices that are intended  
to minimize unpleasant surprises for users, 
and we offer recommendations on the 
general privacy policy and on enhanced 
privacy measures to supplement it. 
Decision Path for Building Privacy into 
Apps
 Use a checklist to consider the types of data your  
app could access or collect.
 Decide what personally identifiable data your app  
needs for its basic functions.
 Decide whether you will collect any non-essential  
data or “sensitive information.”
 Decide on your data use, sharing, retention, and  
security practices.
 
 Prepare a statement of your general privacy  
policy, covering your data practices including  
any enhanced measures.
 Decide on your need for enhanced measures.
 If needed, decide whether to use “special notices”  
or the combination of a short privacy statement and  
privacy controls.
8
Start with a Data Checklist
The most efficient way to build privacy  
into an app is to consider it at the outset  
of the development process. App 
developers should also consider privacy 
when making updates in technology and 
business practices. 
As a first step, create a checklist to assess 
your app’s potential collection, use, and 
disclosure of personally identifiable data. 
The checklist will facilitate design and 
privacy practice decisions that reduce risks 
for both you and your users. A checklist is 
also useful in preparing a general privacy 
policy, special notices, and privacy controls.
Consider the Data
Consider the personally identifiable data14 
your app may collect, use, or disclose to 
third parties. You should also consider the 
data collection and use practices of any 
third-party software (such as libraries or 
SDKs) used in your app. This may require 
testing, as well as reading about the third-
party software’s data collection practices.15 
Types or categories of personally identifiable 
data include the following:
• 
Unique device identifier 
• 
Geo-location (GPS, WiFi, user-entered) 
• 
Mobile phone number
 
Email address
• 
User’s name 
• 
Text messages or email 
• 
Call logs 
• 
Contacts/address book 
• 
Financial and payment information 
• 
Health and medical information  
PRIVACY ON THE GO
• 
Photos or videos 
• 
Web browsing history 
• 
Apps downloaded or used 
Create a Checklist
Use a checklist or matrix to record the types 
or categories of personally identifiable 
data collected and answer the following 
questions for each type of data:
 •�Is the data type necessary for your 
app’s basic functionality (that is, within 
the reasonably expected context of the 
app’s functions as described to users)?
 •�Is the data type necessary for business 
reasons (such as billing)?
 •�How will you use the data?
 •�Will it be necessary to store data off the 
device, on your servers? 
 •�How long will you need to store the data 
on your servers? 
 •�Will you share the data with third 
parties (such as ad networks, analytics 
companies, service providers)? If so, 
with whom will you share it? 
 •�How will third parties use the data? 
 •�Who in your organization will have 
access to user data?
 •�Is your app directed to or likely to be 
used by children under the age of 13?
 •�What parts of the mobile device do  
you have permissions to access?  
Can you provide users with the ability  
to modify permissions?

PRIVACY ON THE GO
Privacy Practices
Once you have used a checklist to 
consider all the personally identifiable  
data that your app could collect, you 
are ready to make decisions about your 
privacy practices. These decisions include 
what data you will collect, how you will use 
it, how long you will retain it, with whom 
you will share it, how you will secure it, 
and what choices you will give your users 
about their data.
Be Transparent
• Make your privacy practices available 
to users before the app is downloaded 
and any data is collected. You can 
accomplish this is by making your 
general privacy policy available from  
the app platform. 
• Make your general privacy policy  
readily accessible from within the app. 
• In addition, use enhanced measures to 
draw users’ attention to data practices  
that may be unexpected or that involve 
sensitive information. 
• Keep your privacy policy communications  
up-to-date in reflecting your actual data- 
handling practices.
Limit Data Collection
• Avoid or minimize the collection of 
personally identifiable data for uses not 
related to your app’s basic functionality, 
and limit the retention of such data to the 
period necessary to support the intended 
function or to meet legal requirements. 
• Avoid or limit the collection of  
sensitive information. 
• If your app is directed to children under 
the age of 13 or if you know that you 
are collecting personal information from 
children under the age of 13, you may 
have additional obligations under federal 
law.16 
• Use an app-specific or other non-
persistent device identifier rather than  
a persistent, globally unique identifier.
• Give users control over the collection  
of any personally identifiable data  
used for purposes other than the app’s  
basic functions.
• The default settings should be  
privacy protective.
• You may want to explain the 
consequences of not allowing the 
collection of the data.
Limit Data Retention 
Do not retain data that can be used to 
identify a user or device beyond the time 
period necessary to complete the function 
for which the data were collected or beyond 
what was disclosed to the user.
• Adopt procedures for deleting  
personally identifiable user data  
that you no longer need.
Give Users Access
• Develop mechanisms to give users 
access to the personally identifiable  
data that the app collects and retains 
about them.  
10
Use Security Safeguards
Use security safeguards to protect personally 
identifiable data from unauthorized access, 
use, disclosure, modification, or destruction. 
Safeguards should include, but not be limited 
to, the following:
• Limit access to personally identified user 
data by those inside your organization to 
a need-to-know basis.
• Use encryption in the transit and storage 
of personally identifiable data.
• If you collect payment card information, 
comply with the Payment Card Industry 
Data Security Standard.17 
• Work with others in the ecosystem to 
ensure the application of appropriate 
security measures to protect personally 
identifiable data.
Be Accountable 
• You are accountable for complying with 
applicable laws and with your general 
privacy policy and any privacy notices  
you provide. 
• Make someone in your organization 
responsible for reviewing your general 
privacy policy whenever the app is 
updated or your business practices 
change. This person should also maintain 
an archive of previous versions of the 
policy, confirm your rules for limiting 
internal access to personally identifiable 
user data, act as the point of contact  
for privacy questions and comments,  
and stay informed of new privacy laws 
and regulations. 
• Ensure that all who work in your 
organization receive training in privacy 
obligations and in your own policies 
and practices. Such training should be 
provided at least annually and to new 
employees as they are hired.
• In addition to state and federal privacy 
laws, international jurisdictions have data 
protection laws that may apply to the  
data collection practices of your app.
General Privacy Policy
When you have decided on the privacy 
practices you will use in your app, you 
are ready to describe them in a general 
privacy policy. The policy should provide  
a comprehensive overview of your 
practices, and should comply with legal 
requirements for such policies.18 The 
following recommendations are intended 
to make your general privacy policy 
statement more effective and meaningful 
in providing transparency about your  
data practices.
Make It Easy to Find
• Make the privacy policy conspicuously 
accessible to users and potential users.19
• Post or link the policy on the app platform 
page, to make it available to users before 
the app is downloaded.20 
• Link to the policy within the app (for 
example, on controls/settings page). 
Consider hosting the privacy policy in  
the browser to facilitate updates in case 
your practices change.21  
PRIVACY ON THE GO
11
PRIVACY ON THE GO
Make It Easy to Read
• Make the privacy policy clear and 
understandable by using plain  
language and a format that is  
readable on a mobile device.
• One format is a layered notice  
that highlights the most relevant  
privacy issues.22 
• Another format is a grid or “nutrition 
label for privacy” that displays your 
privacy practices by data type.23 
• Graphics or icons can help users to easily 
recognize privacy practices and settings. 
• Privacy icons will be most effective  
if they are widely used and consumer 
comprehension is supported by an 
awareness campaign.24 
Describe Your Practices
The privacy policy should describe your 
practices regarding the collection, use, 
sharing, disclosure, and retention of 
personally identifiable data, including  
at least the following items:
• The types or categories of personally 
identifiable data collected by the app.25 
• The uses and retention period for  
each type or category of personally 
identifiable data. 
• Whether your app, or a third party, 
collects payment information for  
in-app purchases.
• The categories of third parties with 
whom the app may share personally 
identifiable data.26 Such third parties 
include advertising networks and 
analytics providers. Provide a link to 
third parties’ privacy policy statements, 
where available.
• The choices a user has regarding the 
collection, use, and sharing of user 
information, with instructions on how to 
exercise those choices. 
• The process for a user to review 
and request corrections to his or her 
personally identifiable information 
maintained by the app, if available.27 
• A means for users to contact the app 
developer with questions or concerns.
• The effective date of the privacy policy 
and the process for notifying users of 
material changes to it.28  
12
Enhanced Measures
If your app collects sensitive information 
or personally identifiable data not needed 
for its basic functionality, then supplement 
your general privacy policy with enhanced 
measures to alert users. 
Special Notices 
One way to do this is through the use of 
“special notices.” 29  
Practices that are likely to deserve special 
notice include the following:
• Collection, use or disclosure of personally 
identifiable data not required for your 
app’s basic functionality.30  
• Accessing text messages, call logs, 
contacts or potentially privacy-sensitive 
device features such as camera, dialer, 
and microphone. 
•  A change in your data practices  
that involves new, unexpected  
uses or disclosures of personally 
identifiable data.31 
•  The collection or use of sensitive 
information (such as precise  
geo-location, financial or medical 
information, passwords). 
•  The disclosure to third parties  
of personally identifiable information  
for their own use, including use  
for advertising. 
Special Notices
• Deliver special notices in context, in many cases just 
before the specific data are to be collected.
• Explain the intended uses and any third parties to 
whom user data would be disclosed.
• Provide an easy way for users to choose whether or 
not to allow the collection or use of the data.  Avoid 
take-it-or-leave-it choices, but when an app developer 
makes use of the app contingent on collection of the 
data, that choice should be made clear.
• Include a link to the general privacy policy, if feasible.
PRIVACY ON THE GO
13
PRIVACY ON THE GO
Short Privacy Statement and  
Privacy Controls
Another approach is to use the  
combination of a short privacy statement 
and privacy controls. 
• The short privacy statement should 
highlight the potentially unexpected 
practices and sensitive information 
discussed above under Special Notices.
• Readily accessible privacy controls 
should give users a convenient way  
to make choices and to change them 
when desired. The operating system  
may provide such controls.
Privacy Controls  
or Settings
• Provide privacy controls 
in a settings menu 
or “dashboard” that 
is readily accessible 
within the app.
• Address all potentially 
unexpected practices 
and sensitive data.
• Include a mechanism 
to revoke prior choices.

III. Recommendations for App Platform Provid-
In the Joint Statement of Principles of 
February 2012, the major app platform 
providers (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, 
Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, and 
Research In Motion) and the California 
Attorney General agreed to certain practices 
to increase consumer privacy protections 
in the mobile marketplace.32 In addition, 
the platform providers pledged to work with 
the Attorney General on best practices for 
mobile privacy in general. The following 
recommendations are offered as a step in 
the development of such best practices. 
In this section, we encourage platform 
providers to use their pivotal role to improve 
privacy practices and privacy understanding  
among developers and consumers. 
Privacy Practices
• Give consumers an opportunity to 
learn about an app’s privacy practices 
before downloading the app by making 
app developers’ general privacy policy 
conspicuously accessible to users and 
potential users on the app platform.
• Educate app developers about their 
obligations to respect consumer privacy 
and disclose to consumers what personally 
identifiable information they collect, how 
they use the information, with whom they 
share it, and other privacy practices.  
• Provide app users with tools to report apps 
that do not comply with applicable laws, 
or their privacy policies or terms of service 
about which they have questions.
• Make it easy for users to find out  
how to contact you about apps,  
such as through a link on the app 
platform page.
• Implement processes to respond to  
these reports. 
• Help to educate consumers on  
mobile privacy.
• Provide educational information on  
or linked from the app platform.
• Encourage consumers to review the 
app privacy policy before downloading 
an app.
• Encourage consumers to look for  
privacy choices and controls in apps  
after downloading.
• Inform parents of resources available 
to help protect their children’s privacy, 
such as the FTC’s information for 
parents on the Children’s Online 
Privacy Protection Act.33 
15
 
IV. Recommendations for Advertising Net-
A common business model for mobile 
apps today is based on delivering targeted 
advertising to app users.34 The collection 
of user information is enabled by the app, 
with the related data flows remaining largely 
invisible to users. Ad networks should provide 
app developers with clear, comprehensive 
information on their privacy practices. 
In this section, we offer recommendations 
intended to help establish privacy practices 
for in-app mobile ad technologies. The 
recommendations address transparency 
and increased user control over the use of 
personally identifiable data by third parties 
for purposes of behavioral advertising.35 
Privacy Practices
• Prepare a privacy policy that describes 
your collection, use, disclosure, and 
retention of personally identifiable user 
data. See the recommendations for app 
developers in Section II for more on what 
to include at a minimum in your general 
privacy policy.
• Provide your privacy policy to the app 
developers who will enable the delivery 
of targeted ads through your network. 
Provide a link to your privacy policy 
for app developers to make available 
to users before they download and/or 
activate the app. 
• Provide clear information on the impact of 
your practices on app SDKs.
• Avoid delivering ads outside the context 
of the app. Examples are delivering ads 
by modifying browser settings or placing 
icons on the mobile desktop. 
• Use enhanced measures and  
obtain prior consent from users  
before delivering out-of-app ads.  
(See Section II.)
• When delivering out-of-app ads,  
provide clear attribution to the host 
application responsible.
• Use enhanced measures and obtain  
prior consent from users before accessing 
personal information such as phone 
number, email address or name. (See 
Section II.)
• Move away from the use of unchangeable 
device-specific identifiers and transition 
to using app-specific and/or temporary 
device identifiers.
• Transmit user data securely, using 
encryption for permanent unique device 
identifiers and personal information, such 
as an email address or phone number.
16
V. Recommendations for Others
In this section, we highlight opportunities 
for collaboration among other players in the 
mobile ecosystem. 
Operating System Developers
• Work with mobile carriers and other 
appropriate parties to facilitate timely 
patching of security vulnerabilities.
• Work with device manufacturers and 
mobile carriers on setting cross-platform 
standards for privacy controls, means  
of enabling the delivery of special privacy 
notices, and privacy icons.
• Develop global privacy settings and 
overrides that users can use to set controls 
for personally identifiable data, features 
or hardware configurations that can be 
accessed by apps.
• Provide tools for app developers that 
enable comprehensive evaluation  
of data collection, use and transmission. 
Mobile Carriers
• Leverage your ongoing relationship with 
your mobile customers to educate them 
on privacy protection. 
• Encourage consumers to review the 
app privacy policy statement before 
downloading an app.
• Encourage consumers to look for  
privacy choices and controls in apps  
after downloading.
• Help to educate parents on mobile 
privacy and safety for their children. 
Consider, for example, providing 
information on available resources, 
such as the FTC’s information for 
parents on the Children’s Online 
Privacy Protection Act.36  
• Work with operating system developers 
and other appropriate parties to facilitate 
timely patching of security vulnerabilities.
• Work with operating system developers 
and device manufacturers on setting cross-
platform standards for privacy controls, 
means of enabling the delivery of special 
privacy notices, and privacy icons.

9 The Principles were first articulated by the U.S. 
Department of Health Education and Welfare 
in 1973, in recognition of the impact of the 
computerization of information on individual privacy 
interests and intended to be used in the evaluation 
and consideration of systems, processes, or 
programs that impact individual privacy. In 1980, 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development codified them in its Guidelines on 
the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows 
of Personal Data. While the FIPPs remain central 
to privacy protection, some privacy scholars have 
begun to question the adequacy of the traditional 
approach in the era of Big Data. See, for example, 
Paul Ohm, Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding 
to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization, 57 UCLA 
L. Rev. 1701 (2010), and Paul M. Schwartz and

29 “Special notices” are consistent with the concept of 
privacy notices delivered in times and places where 
they are useful to consumers that is encouraged 
in the White House’s Consumer Data Privacy in 
a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting 
Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global 
Digital Economy (February 2012) and in the Federal 
Trade Commission’s Protecting Consumer Privacy 
in an Era of Rapid Change: Recommendations for 
Businesses and Policymakers (March 2012).For 
an understanding of when a data practice could be 
considered “expected,” and therefore not needing 
a special notice, see the FTC report’s discussion of 
the need to consider the context of the interaction 
between a business and a consumer and their 
suggestion that practices that are “consistent with 
22
PRIVACY ON THE GO
the context of the transaction or the consumer’s 
existing relationship with the business, or are 
required or specifically authorized by law” would not 
be unexpected (pages 38-39 of the report cited).
30 Basic functionality includes support for internal 
operations. As defined by the FTC in the December 
2012 amendments to the Children’s Online Privacy 
Protection Rule, support for the internal operations 
of the website or online service means those 
activities necessary to: (a) maintain or analyze the 
functioning of the website or online service; (b) 
perform network communications; (c) authenticate 
users of, or personalize the content on, the website 
or online service; (d) serve contextual advertising 
on the website or online service or cap the 
frequency of advertising; (e) protect the security 
or integrity of the user, website, or online service; 
(f) ensure legal or regulatory compliance; or (g) 
fulfill a request of a user; so long as the information 
collected for the activities listed in paragraphs (a)-
(g) is not used or disclosed to contact a specific 
individual, including through behavioral advertising, 
to amass a profile on a specific individual, or for 
any other purpose. The text of the Rule is available 
at www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/12/coppa.shtm.
31 If you make material changes to your data 
practices, in addition to updating your general 
privacy policy statement, use a special notice. The 
notice should alert users to new collection, use or 
disclosure of personally identifiable data. Provide 
a special notice before implementing the new 
practice and get user consent before applying it to 
previously collected data.
